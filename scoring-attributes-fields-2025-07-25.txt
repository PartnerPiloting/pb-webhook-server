## Field Definitions

| Field Name | Primary Type | All Types | Sample Values | Notes |
|------------|--------------|-----------|---------------|-------|
| `Active` | boolean | boolean | true | - |
| `Attribute Id` | string | string | A | K | STEP-A | - |
| `Category` | string | string | Positive | Step | Negative | - |
| `Examples` | string | string |

| `Heading` | string | string | Interest in Emerging Tech / AI Enthusiasm | Financial Ability from Income/Career | Disqualifying Check (Immediate Stop) | - |
| `Instructions` | Long Text | string, Long Text | Scoring Range
0–3 pts = minimal or vague interest (e.g. one-off “AI is interesting” comment).
4–7 pts = occasional mentions or passive sharing of AI articles.
8–11 pts = regular AI/ML posts, online courses, or project updates.
12–15 pts = strong advocate: publishes thought-leadership, demos tools, speaks at AI events.
Award points based on the depth, frequency, and recency of demonstrated engagement with emerging tech or AI.
 | 0–4 pts = Early-career, unstable job history, frequent short stints (< 1 yr), low-level titles. Minimal capacity for funding or dedicated focus on external ventures.
5–9 pts = Mid-career stability (3–5 yrs per role) or first supervisory title; evidence of stable, modest disposable income, suggesting capacity for modest investment or time commitment.
10–14 pts = Senior contributor or manager; 5 + yrs in field; clear salary head-room; some savings/investment mentions. Strong indicators of both financial capacity and potential for dedicated time/focus.
15–20 pts = Executive / Director / Partner; long tenure, stock options, or passive income streams; explicit comments about “next chapter” or investing in ventures. Clear capacity for significant funding and a strong intent/ability to dedicate focus to new ventures.

Award points based on a holistic assessment of the candidate’s financial head-room, seniority, and tenure stability. The aim is to gauge their overall capacity to fund and dedicate time/focus to a side venture. When conflicting signals exist (e.g., high seniority but unstable tenure), prioritize the highest indicators of potential for both funding and focus.
