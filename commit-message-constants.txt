refactor: standardize field constant naming

This commit standardizes field constant naming throughout the codebase:

- Change JOB_FIELDS to JOB_TRACKING_FIELDS as the primary constant
- Add missing fields to JOB_TRACKING_FIELDS (ERROR, PROGRESS, LAST_CLIENT)
- Update references in scripts/smart-resume-client-by-client.js
- Remove unnecessary legacy imports in jobTracking.js
- Add clear deprecation comments and documentation
- Update FORMULA_FIELDS to use the primary constants

This is part of the comprehensive field standardization effort and helps
prevent inconsistencies in field references that were causing methods
to appear "missing" when they actually existed.
