# Handover Document: Fix for "Object passed as sessionId" Errors

## Summary of Changes

In this session, we addressed multiple issues related to logger instantiation and run ID handling in the webhook server code. The primary focus was on fixing "Object passed as sessionId to StructuredLogger constructor" errors that were appearing in the logs.

## Key Issues Identified

1. **Direct StructuredLogger Instantiation**: Many services were directly instantiating StructuredLogger without proper parameter validation, leading to objects being passed where strings were expected.

2. **normalizeRunId Function Issues**: The normalizeRunId function wasn't properly handling objects passed as parameters and could sometimes return objects instead of strings.

3. **Parameter Handling in Run ID Services**: Several functions in unifiedRunIdService.js had signature mismatches and improper parameter handling.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Added Safe Logger Creation Pattern

- Created and leveraged the `createSafeLogger` function that validates and safely handles parameters before creating a StructuredLogger instance
- Updated files to use this pattern consistently:
  ```javascript
  const logger = createSafeLogger('SYSTEM', null, 'service_name');
  ```

### 2. Enhanced normalizeRunId Function

- Added robust type checking to handle different input types
- Improved error handling when objects are incorrectly passed
- Ensured the function always returns either a string or null:
  ```javascript
  function normalizeRunId(runId) {
    // Handle objects incorrectly passed as runId
    if (typeof runId === 'object') {
      logger.error(`Object passed to normalizeRunId instead of string`);
      // Extract usable ID or return null
    }
    // ...rest of function
  }
  ```

### 3. Fixed Function Parameter Handling

- Updated registerApifyRunId and registerRunRecord functions to fix signature mismatches
- Added proper parameter validation in critical service functions
- Ensured consistent error handling patterns

## Files Modified

1. **Core Services**:
   - services/unifiedRunIdService.js
   - services/runIdValidator.js
   - services/runRecordAdapterSimple.js

2. **Additional Service Files**:
   - services/postScoringMetricsHandler.js
   - services/jobTrackingErrorHandling.js
   - services/renderLogService.js
   - services/jobMetricsService.js
   - services/airtableServiceAdapter.js
   - services/simpleJobTracking.js
   - services/unifiedJobTrackingRepository.js

3. **Batch Processing**:
   - postBatchScorer.js

## Commits Made

1. **First Commit**: "Fix logger object parameter issues and normalizeRunId function"
   - Updated core services to use safe logger creation
   - Enhanced normalizeRunId to properly handle all input types

2. **Second Commit**: "Fix remaining StructuredLogger direct instantiations with createSafeLogger"
   - Updated all remaining service files to use createSafeLogger pattern
   - Fixed additional instances in postBatchScorer.js

## Next Steps

1. **Verify Error Resolution**: Review logs after deployment to confirm that the "Object passed as sessionId" errors have been resolved.

2. **Code Complexity Assessment**: Review if the current solution is overly complex or if there's unnecessary validation that could be simplified.

3. **Root Cause Analysis**: Determine if all the root causes have been addressed or if there are additional underlying issues.

4. **Further Optimization**: Consider if more services could benefit from using the centralized logger helpers.

## Technical Debt Considerations

1. **Logger Factory Consolidation**: Consider centralizing all logger creation to a single factory to ensure consistency.

2. **Parameter Validation Strategy**: Review if the current approach to parameter validation is optimal or if a more streamlined pattern could be used.

3. **Logger Interface**: Consider if the current StructuredLogger API is intuitive enough or if it needs redesign to prevent future misuse.
