## Notes & Considerations 📝

### Development Workflow
- Always test changes in staging environment first
- Use feature flags for new functionality
- Validate multi-client compatibility for all changes
- Keep documentation updated with changes

### Field Analysis Results
**Key fields to keep:**
- LinkedIn Profile URL, Profile Full JSON, Posts Content
- AI Score, Scoring Status, Date Scored, Posts JSON Status
- Date Posts Scored, Posts Relevance Score, Top Scoring Post
- All configuration table fields (attributes, instructions, credentials)

### Monitoring Points
- JSON parsing success rates (target: >95%)
- Gemini API response times and costs
- Client processing success rates
- Daily automation execution logs

## Quick Reference 🔗

### Important Endpoints
- **Multi-tenant post scoring**: `POST /run-post-batch-score?limit=100`
- **Single client test**: `POST /run-post-batch-score?clientId=guy-wilson&limit=5`
- **JSON diagnostics**: `GET /api/json-quality-analysis`

### Key Files for Development
- `postBatchScorer.js` - Multi-tenant post scoring
- `services/clientService.js` - Client management
- `utils/jsonRepair.js` - JSON parsing utilities
- `PB-Webhook-Server-Documentation.md` - System documentation

### Next Session Priorities
1. Database field cleanup
2. Development environment setup
3. First new client onboarding preparation
