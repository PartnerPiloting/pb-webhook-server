# Render API Logging Investigation - August 2025

## Summary
Investigation into Render's `/v1/logs` API revealed fundamental limitations that make it unsuitable for comprehensive log analysis.

## Key Findings

### API Limitations Discovered
1. **Incomplete Log Stream**: The `/v1/logs` API only provides a subset of logs compared to the Render web dashboard
2. **Missing Diagnostic Logs**: Critical `[CLIENT:SYSTEM]` logs are filtered out by the API
3. **Timestamp Inconsistencies**: Logs that appear in both sources show different timestamps
4. **Filtering Applied**: API appears to provide mostly application stdout and deployment events, not detailed diagnostics

### Evidence
- Created `raw-log-viewer-final.js` to fetch complete API output
- Compared API results with Render web dashboard screenshots
- Confirmed that detailed processing logs (`[CLIENT:SYSTEM]` messages) are missing from API responses
- Proved that API provides incomplete data for debugging batch scoring issues

### Tools Created (for documentation purposes)
- `check-render-logs.js` - Original comprehensive log analysis script
- `raw-log-viewer-final.js` - Diagnostic tool to show raw API output
- `simple-log-test.js` - Minimal test to isolate API limitations

## Conclusion
**Recommendation**: Abandon Render API-based log analysis in favor of application-level summary logging to Airtable.

## Next Steps
1. Remove logging infrastructure scripts
2. Implement batch summary logging system
3. Use Airtable AI for business intelligence queries
4. Reserve Render dashboard for targeted troubleshooting with specific time windows
