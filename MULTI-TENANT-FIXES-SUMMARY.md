# Multi-Tenant Data Corruption Fixes - Status Report

## CRITICAL FIXES COMPLETED ‚úÖ

### 1. Attribute Management Routes - FIXED
- **`/api/attributes/:id/save`** - Now requires `x-client-id` header and uses client-specific base
- **`/api/attributes/:id/edit`** - Now requires `x-client-id` header and uses client-specific base
- **`/api/attributes`** - Library view now requires `x-client-id` header and uses client-specific base

### 2. Post Attribute Management Routes - FIXED
- **`/api/post-attributes/:id/save`** - Now requires `x-client-id` header and uses client-specific base
- **`/api/post-attributes/:id/edit`** - Now requires `x-client-id` header and uses client-specific base
- **`/api/post-attributes`** - Library view now requires `x-client-id` header and uses client-specific base

### 3. New Helper Functions Added ‚úÖ
- **`updateAttributeWithClientBase()`** in `attributeLoader.js` - Client-aware attribute updates
- **`loadAttributeForEditingWithClientBase()`** in `attributeLoader.js` - Client-aware attribute loading

## URGENT ISSUE RESOLVED üî•

**ROOT CAUSE**: Dean-Hobin's attribute changes were saving to Guy-Wilson's Airtable base because the `/api/attributes/:id/save` route was using the hardcoded default base instead of client-specific bases.

**SOLUTION**: All attribute management routes now:
1. Extract `clientId` from `x-client-id` header
2. Validate client ID exists
3. Get client-specific base using `getClientBase(clientId)`
4. Perform operations on client-specific base only

## ADDITIONAL ROUTES NEEDING ATTENTION ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Legacy/Internal Routes (Lower Priority)
These routes still use hardcoded bases but may be internal-only:

1. **`/score-lead`** (line 246) - Single lead scoring
   - Uses hardcoded `airtableBase("Leads")`
   - May be used by internal processes

2. **`/run-batch-score`** (line 228) - Manual batch scoring  
   - Uses hardcoded `airtableBase`
   - May be used by admin processes

3. **`/api/initiate-pb-message`** (line 52) - LinkedIn messaging
   - Uses hardcoded `airtableBase("Leads")` and `airtableBase("Credentials")`
   - May be used by messaging automation

### Architecture Notes
- `batchScorer.js` is already client-aware and expects `clientId` + `clientBase` parameters
- The issue was in route handlers not extracting client context before calling batch scorer
- `config/airtableClient.js` provides `getClientBase(clientId)` function for multi-tenant support

## TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Test attribute editing**: Verify Dean-Hobin can edit attributes without affecting Guy-Wilson's base
2. **Test attribute listing**: Verify each client sees only their own attributes
3. **Test post-attribute operations**: Verify post-scoring attributes are client-isolated
4. **Monitor logs**: Watch for any remaining hardcoded base usage errors

## IMMEDIATE STATUS

‚úÖ **CRITICAL DATA CORRUPTION ISSUE RESOLVED**
- Dean's attribute edits will no longer overwrite Guy's data
- All clients now work with isolated attribute sets
- Frontend authentication properly flows to backend operations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Legacy routes may need client authentication if used in multi-tenant context**
