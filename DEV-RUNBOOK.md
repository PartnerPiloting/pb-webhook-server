# Dev Runbook: Start API and Frontend Reliably (Generic)

This guide is a generic, repeatable playbook for this repo and similar Node/Next.js projects. It prevents the common multi-hour pitfalls: terminal reuse killing servers, port conflicts, missing env, and unclear health checks. Use it when starting fresh, and when something breaks mid-session.

## QuickStart (fresh machine or new chat)
Prereqs
- Node.js LTS installed (check: `node -v`, `npm -v`)
- VS Code installed
- Git installed (optional but recommended)

Initial setup (once per clone)
1) Install backend deps at repo root:
  - `npm install`
2) Install frontend deps:
  - `npm --prefix linkedin-messaging-followup-next install`
3) Environment file:
  - Create `.env` at repo root if missing.
  - Add required keys (Airtable, OpenAI/Vertex, PB_WEBHOOK_SECRET, etc.). You can start without some; endpoints will warn you if missing.

Ports (dev policy)
- API: 3001 (fixed)
- Frontend: 3000 (or 3007 if 3000 is busy)
- Frontend must point to API: `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001`

## TL;DR
- Use one terminal for the API only. Don’t reuse or close it.
- Use a second terminal for checks and the frontend.
 - If the API is already running: do not restart it. Just verify health, then start the frontend.

## Start the API (dedicated terminal)
Preferred (VS Code task, keeps its own terminal):
- VS Code → Tasks → Run Task → "API: Start (keep running)"

Option A (with nodemon, auto-restart on file changes):
- npm run dev:api

Option B (no auto-restarts, fewer moving parts):
- node index.js

Verify it’s up (generic health):
- curl http://localhost:3001/basic-test  (expect a short OK text)
- or: curl http://localhost:3001/api/test/minimal-json  (expect simple JSON)
- or: use your feature’s status/health endpoint if it has one

Note: If you see exit code 130 or the API “disappears,” the terminal was interrupted/closed (e.g., window reused or closed). Fix: start via the VS Code task above (or a fresh terminal), and leave that terminal alone.

## Start the Frontend (separate terminal)
Always point the frontend at the local API on 3001:
- NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001 npm --prefix linkedin-messaging-followup-next run dev

If port 3000 is busy:
- NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001 npm --prefix linkedin-messaging-followup-next run dev -- --port 3007

Open your feature page (examples):
- Top Scoring Leads: http://localhost:3000/top-scoring-leads?testClient=Guy-Wilson
- If you used 3007: http://localhost:3007/top-scoring-leads?testClient=Guy-Wilson
- For other features: replace the path (e.g., /my-new-feature) as appropriate.

If the API is already running and healthy (HTTP 200 from /api/top-scoring-leads/status), skip any API restart and go straight to starting the frontend.

## Quick port checks (Windows bash)
- netstat -ano | findstr LISTENING | findstr :3000
- netstat -ano | findstr LISTENING | findstr :3001
- netstat -ano | findstr LISTENING | findstr :3007

No LISTENING entries means that port is free.

## Ports overview
- API: 3001 (fixed for local dev)
- Frontend (Next.js): 3000 by default; use --port 3007 if 3000 is busy
- Frontend always needs NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001 so it talks to your local API

## Known gotcha and fix
- Symptom: API starts, then status check fails; exit code is 130.
- Cause: The terminal/task was reused or closed (SIGINT), not a crash.
- Fix: Keep the API in its own terminal (or use the VS Code task below), and use a second terminal for everything else.
 - Tip: Avoid combined tasks when debugging. Start API first (dedicated window), then frontend.

## Keep it running (best practices)
- Start via VS Code task: API: Start (keep running) so it gets its own terminal.
- Do not reuse or close that terminal tab; use a separate tab for checks and the frontend.
- When VS Code asks to restart background tasks for a new task, choose not to restart the API task.
- Prefer `node index.js` (no auto-restart) if nodemon restarts are noisy.
- Avoid closing VS Code or letting the machine sleep while you need the API running.

### When it can still stop
- You close/restart VS Code, the terminal, or the task.
- You start another task and accept “restart running tasks.”
- The machine sleeps or reboots.

### If it stops
1) Check: `curl http://localhost:3001/api/test/minimal-json` (expect 200 + JSON) or `curl http://localhost:3001/basic-test` (expect 200).
2) If not 200: re-run the task “API: Start (keep running)” or `npm run dev:api`, or `node index.js`.
3) If the old terminal is gone and port 3001 is occupied:
  - Find PID: `netstat -ano | findstr LISTENING | findstr :3001`
  - Kill PID: `taskkill /PID <PID> /F` (Windows)
  - As a last resort: `taskkill /IM node.exe /F` (kills all Node processes)

## VS Code tasks (optional)
We’ve added two tasks under .vscode/tasks.json:
- API: Start (keep running)
- Frontend: Start (port 3000)
Use the VS Code command palette: “Tasks: Run Task”.

## For AI Assistant/Agent (automation-safe instructions)

To avoid interrupting long-running servers when executing automated checks:

1) Never reuse the API’s terminal. Treat it as read-only once started.
2) Prefer VS Code Tasks to ensure isolation:
  - Run Task: "API: Start (keep running)"
  - Run Task: "Frontend: Start (port 3000)"
3) If tasks are unavailable or blocked, use the Windows launcher below (opens two separate terminal windows):

  - Double-click `start-dev-windows.bat` (or run it from Explorer). It will:
    - Open one terminal for the API at port 3001
    - Open another for the Frontend at port 3000 with NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL pre-set

4) Do not run curl/health checks in the API terminal. Use a separate terminal.
5) If you accidentally closed the API terminal or see exit code 130, just re-run the task or the batch file.

Health checks (run in a separate terminal):
- `curl http://localhost:3001/basic-test`
- `curl http://localhost:3001/api/test/minimal-json`
- Feature: `curl http://localhost:3001/api/top-scoring-leads/status`

Note: Automation should not attempt to spawn long-running servers in the same execution context as ad-hoc checks; use the dedicated tasks or the batch launcher.

---

## One-click Windows launcher (no VS Code needed)
Use the included batch file to guarantee separate windows:
- Double-click `start-dev-windows.bat` in the repo folder.
- It opens one window for the API (3001) and another for the Frontend (3000) with the correct API base URL.

---

## Health checks you can bookmark (generic)
While the API is running on 3001:
- http://localhost:3001/basic-test (plain text OK)
- http://localhost:3001/api/test/minimal-json (clean JSON)
- http://localhost:3001/ (API landing with quick links, if available)

Feature-specific examples (adapt names accordingly):
- http://localhost:3001/api/top-scoring-leads/status
- UI: http://localhost:3000/top-scoring-leads?testClient=Guy-Wilson

Pattern to reuse for any feature:
- Provide a status endpoint under `/api/<feature>/status` returning 200 when mounted.
- Expose a minimal JSON endpoint somewhere under `/api/test/` for serialization sanity.

## Troubleshooting cookbook (fast answers)

“API worked, then died; exit code 130”
- You (or a task) reused the API’s terminal or closed it. That sends Ctrl+C.
- Fix: Restart via “API: Start (keep running)” and leave that terminal alone.

“Port 3001/3000 is in use”
- Find the PID: `netstat -ano | findstr LISTENING | findstr :3001`
- Kill it: `taskkill /PID <PID> /F`
- If stubborn: `taskkill /IM node.exe /F`

“curl to 3001 fails to connect”
- API isn’t running or wrong port.
- Start API; confirm `basic-test` or `api/test/minimal-json` returns 200.

“Frontend shows nothing or 404”
- Start frontend on 3000 (or 3007) and check console logs.
- Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001` before starting the frontend.

“cross-env not found”
- Use the VS Code task “Frontend: Start (port 3000)” which calls `npm run dev:front`, resolving local devDependencies.
- Or run from a shell where npm scripts can find local binaries.

“Machine slept; servers disappeared”
- Restart API and Frontend tasks; re-run health checks.

“Stuck in a weird state; I just want clean slate”
1) Close all dev terminals (but note which ports were used).
2) Kill leftover node.exe processes.
3) Confirm ports 3000/3001 are free.
4) Start API task; verify health; then start Frontend.

## Reusable development pattern (for any new feature)
- Keep API and UI on predictable ports (3001/3000) in dev.
- UI reads API base from a single env var (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`).
- Add a simple `/status` endpoint for each feature.
- Prefer dry-run defaults for risky operations; add a clear finalize/reset path.
- Provide a “select all by default” path and a “testPageSize/page” option for safe testing.
- Document a few copy-paste health URLs in the README or the API root page.

With this pattern and the isolation rules above, you shouldn’t spend more than a minute getting any feature up in the future.
