fix: standardize field name constants in jobTracking.js

This commit implements comprehensive field name standardization in jobTracking.js:

- Replace all hardcoded string literals with proper constants
- Use CLIENT_RUN_FIELDS and JOB_TRACKING_FIELDS consistently
- Fix 'Error' field reference to use JOB_TRACKING_FIELDS.ERROR
- Add field name validation to prevent Airtable errors
- Standardize STATUS_VALUES usage for consistency

This addresses the "Required JobTracking methods not found: updateAggregateMetrics" error
by ensuring consistent field references across all methods in the JobTracking class.
