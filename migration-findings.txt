RECOMMENDATION:
Prioritize migration of TOP 7 files:

2. routes/apifyProcessRoutes.js (140 calls - CRITICAL)
3. services/apifyRunsService.js (25 calls)

5. services/runRecordServiceV2.js (5 calls)
6. routes/diagnosticRoutes.js (2 calls - cleanup)

These 7 files are used in scoring runs, post harvesting, and run tracking.
