## DEPLOYMENT ASSUMPTIONS

### ‚ùå NEVER ASSUME CODE IS NOT DEPLOYED

**THE RULE:**
When the user says "the code is deployed" or shows a Render deployment screenshot, **BELIEVE THEM 100%**.

**WHAT KEEPS HAPPENING (WRONG):**
AI keeps saying "the debug code wasn't deployed" or "we need to wait for deployment" when:
- User explicitly said it's deployed ‚úÖ
- User showed Render deployment screenshot ‚úÖ  
- Commit hash matches what was pushed ‚úÖ

**WHY THIS IS WRONG:**
Render auto-deploys within 2-3 minutes and the user ALWAYS waits. The deployment system works reliably.

**WASTED TIME:**
This incorrect assumption has wasted time at least 5+ times in one session.

**THE CORRECT APPROACH:**
1. User says "deployed" ‚Üí IT IS DEPLOYED
2. Code doesn't appear in logs ‚Üí THE CODE EXISTS BUT ISN'T EXECUTING
3. Debug logs missing ‚Üí Find why execution stops BEFORE those logs
4. NEVER jump to "deployment didn't work" conclusion

**DEBUGGING PRINCIPLE:**
If deployed code doesn't produce expected logs, the problem is:
- ‚ùå NOT: "Code isn't deployed"
- ‚úÖ YES: "Execution stops before reaching that code"
- ‚úÖ YES: "Code path is different than expected"
- ‚úÖ YES: "Process crashes/exits early"

**VERIFICATION STEPS (IF YOU MUST):**
1. Check file locally to confirm code exists
2. Trace execution path to see if code is reachable
3. Look for early exits, crashes, or returns BEFORE the code
4. Check if code is in different function/file than expected

**NEVER SAY:**
- "The deployment hasn't finished"
- "Render didn't deploy the code"
- "The code isn't on the server yet"
- "We need to wait for deployment"

**ALWAYS INVESTIGATE:**
- Why did execution stop before reaching this code?
- Is this code in the actual execution path?
- What crashed/exited between last log and expected log?
- Is there a different code path being taken?
