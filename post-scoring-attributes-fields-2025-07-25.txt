Low (0-5 points): AI is mentioned neutrally, factually, without explicit positive framing, or the sentiment is mixed, vague, or any positive hints are minor and overshadowed by neutrality, concerns, or a purely technical/objective discussion.

Medium (6-14 points): A clearly positive sentiment towards AI is expressed. The post highlights benefits, opportunities, or constructive uses of AI. The tone is generally optimistic or appreciative of AI's capabilities or potential.

High (15-20 points): Strongly positive and enthusiastic sentiment. The post champions AI's advantages, shows significant excitement for its current or future applications, strongly advocates for its positive aspects, or expresses a clear belief in its transformative power for good." | Evaluate the degree to which the post demonstrates an open-minded perspective towards AI, offers insightful commentary, asks thoughtful questions, or aims to foster a deeper, nuanced discussion, rather than just stating facts or superficial opinions.

Low (0-5 points): Post mentions AI but offers no original thought, insight, or questions. It might be a simple news share, a factual statement without analysis, or a very generic opinion. Lacks depth or an invitation to broader thinking.

Medium (6-14 points): Post shows some level of original thought or analysis regarding AI. It might raise interesting points, connect AI to other concepts in a non-obvious way, or ask questions that encourage further discussion. Shows a willingness to explore AI's implications.

High (15-20 points): Post offers significant insights, a unique perspective, or poses deep, thought-provoking questions about AI, its impact, or its future. It clearly demonstrates critical thinking, intellectual curiosity, and an open-minded approach to understanding AI's complexities and potential. It actively seeks to engage others in a meaningful discussion. | Determine if the post's primary purpose is to directly sell or market the author's own specific product, service, or company, or to directly solicit leads/demos for their business, without offering significant broader insights, educational value, or genuine discussion that stands independently of the promotional aspect.

Condition for Penalty: The penalty applies if the post reads more like an advertisement or a direct sales pitch than a contribution to a broader discussion or sharing of general insights. Mentioning one's company, work, or product is acceptable and often natural if it's part of a larger insightful discussion, case study, or sharing of expertise. The penalty is intended for posts where the promotional call to action or focus on selling is the dominant theme and overshadows any other value.

If condition is met, apply the specified Point Value (e.g., -20). If not met, this attribute contributes 0 to the score. | - |
