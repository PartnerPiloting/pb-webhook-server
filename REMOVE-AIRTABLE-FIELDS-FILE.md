# Removing the airtableFields.js File

After you've verified that all the changes work correctly by following the steps in `TEST-VERIFICATION-STEPS.md`, you can safely remove the deprecated file.

## Deletion Steps

1. Make sure all tests pass and the application is working correctly with no field-related errors
2. Run the following command to delete the file:

```bash
rm c:/Users/guyra/Desktop/pb-webhook-server-dev/constants/airtableFields.js
```

3. Commit the changes with a descriptive message:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "refactor: removed deprecated airtableFields.js, consolidated all constants into airtableUnifiedConstants.js"
```

4. Push the changes to complete the field standardization project:

```bash
git push origin feature/comprehensive-field-standardization
```

## Verification After Deletion

After removing the file, run the application once more to ensure it still functions correctly. The proper imports from `airtableUnifiedConstants.js` should ensure that all functionality remains intact.

If any issues arise after deletion, check that all files that previously imported from `airtableFields.js` have been properly updated to use `airtableUnifiedConstants.js` instead.
