# Render API Integration Questions

## Critical Information Needed

### 1. API Authentication
**Question:** How do we authenticate with Render's API?
- Do you have a Render API key?
- Where is it stored? (Environment variable? Dashboard?)
- What permissions does it need?

**Expected:**
```bash
# Likely something like:
Authorization: Bearer rnd_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### 2. API Endpoint for Logs
**Question:** What is the exact API endpoint to fetch logs?
- Service ID: (what's your Render service ID?)
- Endpoint format: (probably `/v1/services/{serviceId}/logs`)

**Expected:**
```
GET https://api.render.com/v1/services/{serviceId}/logs
  ?startTime=2025-10-07T00:00:00Z
  &endTime=2025-10-07T23:59:59Z
  &limit=1000
```

### 3. Log Response Format
**Question:** What format does Render return logs in?
- JSON array of log objects?
- Plain text with timestamps?
- Structured JSON with metadata?

**Expected (guessing):**
```json
{
  "logs": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2025-10-07T14:23:15.123Z",
      "message": "Error: Unknown field name: Errors",
      "level": "error"
    }
  ],
  "cursor": "next_page_token"
}
```

### 4. Pagination
**Question:** How does pagination work?
- Max logs per request?
- Cursor-based or offset-based?
- Is there a "tail" endpoint for recent logs?

### 5. Rate Limits
**Question:** What are the API rate limits?
- Requests per minute/hour?
- What happens when you hit the limit?
- Is there a way to check remaining quota?

### 6. Time Range Limits
**Question:** What's the max time range per request?
- Can we fetch 7 days in one call?
- Or do we need to chunk by hour/day?

### 7. Log Retention
**Confirmed:** Render keeps logs for 7 days (we discussed this)
**Question:** Is this the same for all plans, or does it vary?

## Research Plan

### Step 1: Check Render Dashboard
- [ ] Find API key in dashboard (Account Settings → API Keys?)
- [ ] Find service ID (Service Settings → Info?)
- [ ] Check if there's API documentation link

### Step 2: Consult Render Documentation
- [ ] Visit https://render.com/docs/api
- [ ] Find logs API endpoint reference
- [ ] Note authentication method
- [ ] Note response format
- [ ] Note rate limits

### Step 3: Test API Call (Manual)
Try a simple curl command to verify:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  "https://api.render.com/v1/services/YOUR_SERVICE_ID/logs?limit=10"
```

### Step 4: Alternative Approach
If Render API is complex/limited, consider:
- **Option A:** Use Render's webhook/log shipping feature (if available)
- **Option B:** Use Render's CLI (`render logs tail`) via child process
- **Option C:** Manual copy/paste workflow (not ideal, but workable)

---

## What We Need to Proceed

### Minimum Required Information:
1. ✅ Render API key (or how to generate one)
2. ✅ Service ID for your production deployment
3. ✅ Logs API endpoint URL
4. ✅ Authentication header format

### Nice to Have:
- Rate limit info (to avoid throttling)
- Max logs per request (to avoid truncation)
- Pagination mechanism (for large log fetches)

---

## Next Steps

**Please provide:**
1. Your Render API key (or help me find it)
2. Your Render service ID (or service name)
3. Link to Render API docs if you've found them

**Then I can:**
- Build `services/renderLogService.js` with correct API calls
- Test fetching logs from production
- Complete the integration

---

## Fallback Plan (If API is Limited)

If Render's API doesn't support log fetching well, we can:

### Option 1: Manual Trigger Workflow
1. You visit Render logs
2. Copy recent logs
3. POST to `/api/analyze-logs` endpoint with logs in body
4. System filters and creates Airtable records
5. You review Production Issues table

**Pros:** No API authentication needed, works immediately
**Cons:** Manual step (but still way better than current)

### Option 2: Render CLI Integration
Use Render's CLI tool via Node child process:
```javascript
const { exec } = require('child_process');
exec('render logs tail --service your-service --json', (err, stdout) => {
  // Parse and process logs
});
```

**Pros:** Official Render tool, reliable
**Cons:** Requires Render CLI installed on server

---

## Decision Point

**Do we have easy API access, or should we use fallback workflow?**
- If API works → Full automation
- If API is tricky → Manual trigger (still huge improvement)

Let me know what you find in the Render dashboard!
