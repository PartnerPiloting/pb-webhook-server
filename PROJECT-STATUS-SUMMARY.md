# Current Project Status Summary

## Recently Completed Work (September 23, 2025)
1. Enhanced lead scoring and reporting with process-specific logging controls:
   - Added environment variables for targeted debugging: `DEBUG_LEAD_SCORING`, `DEBUG_POST_HARVESTING`, `DEBUG_POST_SCORING`
   - Implemented in `utils/structuredLogger.js` with process type parameter
   - Enhanced all major modules to use the appropriate process type for logging

2. Improved testing mode functionality:
   - Clarified the behavior of `FIRE_AND_FORGET_BATCH_PROCESS_TESTING` flag
   - Modified filter formula in `batchScorer.js` to include recently scored leads when in testing mode
   - Added visual indicator in email reports showing if testing mode is enabled

3. Added detailed reason reporting:
   - Included specific reasons why leads or posts aren't processed in various scenarios
   - Enhanced email reports to show these reasons for better visibility
   - Implemented in `batchScorer.js`, `postAnalysisService.js`, and `routes/apifyProcessRoutes.js`

4. Created comprehensive environment variables documentation:
   - Added `ENVIRONMENT-VARIABLES-REFERENCE.md` document
   - Documented all environment variables, their purpose, and example values

5. Successfully committed and pushed all changes to the staging branch.

## Previous Work
1. Successfully redesigned and implemented a new email reporting system for the LinkedIn lead management platform with the following improvements:
   - Created a cleaner, structured email layout with proper tables
   - Added clear section headings for better readability
   - Improved mobile responsiveness with responsive design patterns
   - Fixed duplicate email issues by implementing deduplication logic
   - Properly formatted metrics (success rates, durations, etc.)

## Current System Status
- Smart Resume Processing system is working successfully with 100% success rate according to recent email reports
- Email reporting system has been updated with improved templates and now includes testing mode indicators
- Process-specific logging controls have been implemented for better debugging
- Lead scoring system has been enhanced to properly respect testing mode flag
- Documentation has been improved with comprehensive environment variables reference

## Current Debug Focus
We have been addressing issues with lead scoring for the Guy-Wilson client:

### Lead Scoring Issues
- Problem: Leads with "To Be Scored" status weren't being processed for the Guy-Wilson client
- Root Cause: Misunderstanding about the normal vs. testing mode behavior
- Solution: Enhanced testing mode to override time restrictions when enabled

### Process-Specific Logging Implementation
- Problem: System-wide logging made it hard to isolate issues in specific components
- Solution: Implemented process-specific logging controls for targeted debugging using environment variables:
  - `DEBUG_LEAD_SCORING`: Controls lead scoring logs
  - `DEBUG_POST_HARVESTING`: Controls post harvesting logs
  - `DEBUG_POST_SCORING`: Controls post scoring logs

### Lead Scoring Behavior Clarification
- Normal Mode: Only processes leads with "To Be Scored" status
- Testing Mode: Also includes leads that were scored in the last 2 days
- When no leads are processed, the system now provides detailed reasons in both logs and email reports

We also continue monitoring the previously identified Apify authorization issue, although it's not blocking core functionality.

## System Architecture Context
- Multi-tenant system with client data in separate Airtable bases
- Master Clients base contains client registry and shared tables like "Apify Runs"
- Smart Resume Processing system collects and processes LinkedIn data
- Apify integration handles LinkedIn post scraping with webhooks for data updates
- Process-specific logging system for targeted debugging

## Key Environment Variables
We've documented all environment variables in the new `ENVIRONMENT-VARIABLES-REFERENCE.md` file. Key ones include:

### Core Configuration
- `AIRTABLE_API_KEY`: API key for Airtable access
- `MASTER_CLIENTS_BASE_ID`: ID of the master clients base
- `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`: Path to GCP service account key file
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: API key for OpenAI services

### Logging Controls
- `DEBUG_LEVEL`: General logging verbosity (1-5)
- `DEBUG_LEAD_SCORING`: Enable lead scoring specific logs (true/false)
- `DEBUG_POST_HARVESTING`: Enable post harvesting specific logs (true/false) 
- `DEBUG_POST_SCORING`: Enable post scoring specific logs (true/false)

### Testing Mode
- `FIRE_AND_FORGET_BATCH_PROCESS_TESTING`: When "true", enables testing mode that includes recently scored leads

## Next Steps
1. Testing in Staging Environment:
   - Test lead scoring with the Guy-Wilson client to confirm proper behavior
   - Verify process-specific logging is working correctly
   - Check email reports include testing mode indicator and detailed reasons

2. Potential Future Enhancements:
   - Improve run tracking UI in Airtable
   - Add more detailed reporting on token usage per client
   - Enhance error handling for API rate limits

3. Documentation Improvements:
   - Continue organizing documentation files
   - Add more examples and troubleshooting guides

## Email Template Updates
We've continued to improve the email templates:
- Added proper HTML tables with consistent structure
- Created clear section headings to organize information
- Implemented color coding for success rates (green/yellow/red)
- Added responsive design for better mobile viewing
- Fixed duplicate email issues with deduplication logic
- Added testing mode indicator to help identify when testing mode is active
- Enhanced reason reporting for better visibility into system decisions
