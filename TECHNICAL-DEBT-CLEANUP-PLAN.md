# Technical Debt Cleanup Plan

**Created:** October 6, 2025  
**Purpose:** Systematic plan to reduce technical debt and improve maintainability  
**Status:** Planning document - prioritize after field standardization is complete

---

## Executive Summary

**Current State:** Rapid feature development has led to multiple competing implementations, dead code accumulation, and schema drift between code and database.

**Impact:** Bug fixes require changes in 3-4 different files. Hard to onboard new developers. Increased risk of regressions.

**Recommendation:** Phased cleanup approach starting with low-risk wins, then strategic consolidation.

## Technical Debt Inventory

### üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY - Causing Active Issues

#### 1. Multiple Competing Service Layers

**Problem:** Same functionality implemented 3-5 different ways across the codebase.

**Job Tracking Services (4 implementations):**
- ‚úÖ `services/jobTracking.js` - **KEEP** (newest, cleanest API, uses class-based design)
- ‚ùå `services/unifiedJobTrackingRepository.js` - DEPRECATE (older pattern)
- ‚ùå `services/simpleJobTracking.js` - DEPRECATE (legacy)
- ‚ùå `_archived_legacy/airtable/jobTrackingRepository.js` - DELETE (archived)

**Airtable Services (7+ implementations):**
- ‚úÖ `services/airtableService.js` - **KEEP** (main service, most used)
- ‚ùå `services/airtableServiceSimple.js` - DEPRECATE (redundant)
- ‚ùå `services/airtableServiceAdapter.js` - EVALUATE (adapter pattern, may be useful)
- ‚ùå `services/airtable/airtableService.js` - CONSOLIDATE (different directory!)
- ‚ùå `temp/airtableService.new.js` - DELETE (temp file)
- ‚ùå `services/airtableService.bak.js` - DELETE (backup)
- ‚ùå `services/airtableService.old.js` - DELETE (backup)

**Run Record Services (3+ implementations):**
- ‚úÖ `services/runRecordServiceV2.js` - **KEEP** (v2 suggests current)
- ‚ùå `services/runRecordAdapterSimple.js` - EVALUATE (may be adapter)
- ‚ùå `_archived_legacy/airtable/runRecordRepository.js` - DELETE (archived)

**Impact:**
- When fixing bugs, must update 3-4 files
- Easy to miss one and create inconsistency
- New developers confused about which to use
- Different code paths may use different services

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 weeks (careful migration with testing)

#### 2. Field Name Inconsistency (IN PROGRESS - Current Branch)

**Problem:** Field names handled inconsistently across codebase.

**Examples Found:**
- Constants: `JOB_TRACKING_FIELDS.STATUS` ‚úÖ
- Raw strings: `'Status'` ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Lowercase: `status` ‚ùå
- CamelCase: `endTime` ‚ùå

**Multiple Constant Files:**
- ‚úÖ `constants/airtableUnifiedConstants.js` - **KEEP** (unified, most complete)
- ‚ùå `constants/airtableFields.js` - CONSOLIDATE into unified
- ‚ùå `constants/airtableFields.unified.js` - CONSOLIDATE into unified
- ‚ùå `constants/airtableConstants.js` - CONSOLIDATE into unified
- ‚ùå `src/domain/models/constants.js` - CONSOLIDATE or DELETE

**Current Fixes (feature/comprehensive-field-standardization branch):**
- ‚úÖ Added field validator with auto-normalization
- ‚úÖ Fixed PROFILES_SCORED constant typo
- ‚úÖ Removed deleted fields from Job Tracking operations
- ‚úÖ Normalized field names in JobTracking.updateJob
- ‚è≥ Need to migrate all callers to use constants

**Remaining Work:**
1. Audit all Airtable update/create operations
2. Replace raw strings with constants
3. Add linting rule to enforce constant usage
4. Consolidate constant files into single source of truth

**Estimated Effort:** 1 week (mostly done on current branch)

#### 3. Schema Drift Between Code and Database

**Problem:** Database schema changed October 2, 2025 but code not fully updated.

**Fields Removed from Job Tracking Table:**
- Clients Processed
- Clients With Errors
- Total Profiles Examined
- Successful Profiles
- Total Posts Harvested
- Posts Examined for Scoring
- Posts Successfully Scored
- Profile Scoring Tokens
- Post Scoring Tokens

**What Went Wrong:**
- Fields removed from Airtable
- Comments added saying "removed 2025-10-02"
- But code still tried to write to these fields
- No automated schema validation
- No integration tests caught the issue

**Solution:**
1. ‚úÖ Remove all references to deleted fields (in progress)
2. Create schema validation on startup
3. Add integration tests for Airtable operations
4. Document current schema as single source of truth
5. Add schema migration process for future changes

**Estimated Effort:** 1 week (partially done)

---

### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY - Technical Debt

#### 4. Run ID System Complexity

**Problem:** Multiple competing systems for Run ID validation/generation.

**Files Involved:**
- `utils/runIdSystem.js` - Main system
- `utils/runIdValidator.js` - Separate validator
- `services/jobTracking.js` - Has own validation
- Multiple services do their own normalization

**Issues:**
- No single source of truth
- Validation logic duplicated
- Normalization inconsistent
- Recent bugs suggest fragility

**Solution:**
1. Consolidate into single `runIdSystem.js`
2. Remove duplicate validation logic
3. Add comprehensive unit tests
4. Document Run ID format and rules
5. Consider using TypeScript for type safety

**Estimated Effort:** 1 week

#### 5. Error Handling Inconsistency

**Problem:** Error handling patterns vary across codebase.

**Patterns Found:**
- Try/catch with console.error
- Try/catch with logger.error
- Try/catch with throw
- Try/catch with return error object
- No try/catch (let it bubble)

**Specialized Error Classes:**
- `utils/airtableErrors.js` - Has FieldNameError class
- Some services use it, many don't
- Inconsistent error messages
- Hard to track error types

**Solution:**
1. Define error handling standards
2. Create error classes for common cases
3. Implement consistent logging pattern
4. Add error tracking (see PRODUCTION-ERROR-LOGGING-PLAN.md)
5. Refactor high-value code paths first

**Estimated Effort:** 2 weeks

#### 6. Logging System Fragmentation

**Problem:** Multiple logger implementations and patterns.

**Loggers Found:**
- `utils/structuredLogger.js` - Structured logging system
- `utils/loggerHelper.js` - Helper wrapper
- `console.log` - Direct usage throughout
- `console.error` - Direct usage throughout
- Custom loggers in various services

**Issues:**
- Hard to filter/search logs
- Inconsistent log formats
- Can't easily change log destination
- No log levels in many places

**Solution:**
1. Standardize on `structuredLogger.js`
2. Create convenience wrappers for common use cases
3. Replace console.log/error with logger calls
4. Add log level filtering
5. Consider structured logging service (Datadog, Loggly)

**Estimated Effort:** 1 week

---

### üü¢ LOW PRIORITY - Cleanup & Organization

#### 7. Root Directory Clutter

**Problem:** 50+ test/debug scripts in root directory making it hard to find production code.

**Test/Debug Scripts in Root (Partial List):**
```
af-test.js

check-today-logs.js
find-big-batch.js
search-rec-ids.js
search-for-91.js
simple-log-test.js
test-*.js (20+ files)
```

**Solution:**
1. Create `scripts/debug/` directory
2. Create `scripts/analysis/` directory
3. Move test files to `tests/` directory
4. Move one-time scripts to `scripts/archive/`
5. Delete obsolete scripts
6. Update README with script organization

**Estimated Effort:** 2 hours (low risk, high visibility improvement)

#### 8. Backup Files and Temp Files

**Problem:** Old backup files committed to git.

**Files to Remove:**
```
temp/airtableService.new.js
services/airtableService.bak.js
services/airtableService.old.js
api_start.log
api.log
canary.out.json
canary.out.txt
analysis.txt
```

**Solution:**
1. Verify files are truly obsolete
2. Delete from repository
3. Add to .gitignore patterns
4. Document backup strategy (use git branches instead)

**Estimated Effort:** 1 hour

#### 9. Documentation Overload

**Problem:** Too many docs, unclear which are current.

**Commit Message Documents (15+ files):**
```
COMMIT-MESSAGE-ADDITIONAL-FIXES.md
COMMIT-MESSAGE-APIFY-PROCESS-FIX.md
COMMIT-MESSAGE-AUTH-ERROR-FIX.md
COMMIT-MESSAGE-CLIENT-RUN-DUPLICATION-FIX.md

```

**Architecture Documents (Many):**
```
ARCHITECTURE-DECISIONS.md
BACKEND-DEEP-DIVE.md
SYSTEM-OVERVIEW.md
CLIENT_RUN_RECORD_DESIGN.md
APIFY-INTEGRATION-GUIDE.md
APIFY-MULTITENANT-GUIDE.md
DEV-RUNBOOK.md
DOCS-INDEX.md
[... many more ...]
```

**Solution:**
1. Create `docs/archive/` directory
2. Move commit message docs to `docs/commit-history/` or delete
3. Create `DOCS-CURRENT.md` listing authoritative docs
4. Consolidate overlapping architecture docs
5. Add "Status" and "Last Updated" to each doc
6. Create docs/README.md as entry point

**Estimated Effort:** 4 hours

#### 10. Archived/Legacy Code Still in Repo

**Problem:** Old code in `_archived_legacy/` directory.

**Directory Contents:**
```
_archived_legacy/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ airtable/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ jobTrackingRepository.js
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ runRecordRepository.js
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [other old implementations]
```

**Solution:**
1. Verify nothing references archived code
2. Create git tag for historical reference
3. Delete _archived_legacy directory
4. Document in CHANGELOG.md what was removed and when
5. Note git tag for recovery if needed

**Estimated Effort:** 2 hours

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### For All Phases:

**1. Feature Flags**
- Use environment variables to toggle new vs old code paths
- Gradual rollout to production
- Easy rollback if issues found

**2. Parallel Running**
- Keep old code alongside new during migration
- Log discrepancies between old and new
- Verify identical behavior before cutover

**3. Incremental Migration**
- Migrate one caller at a time
- Test each migration thoroughly
- Don't remove old code until all callers migrated

**4. Comprehensive Testing**
- Add integration tests before refactoring
- Maintain test coverage throughout
- Use tests as safety net

**5. Canary Deployments**
- Deploy to subset of users/clients first
- Monitor error rates closely
- Full rollout only after validation

---

## Success Metrics

### Code Quality Metrics:
- **Lines of Code:** Reduce by 20-30% (remove duplication)
- **Cyclomatic Complexity:** Reduce average complexity
- **Test Coverage:** Increase to >80% for critical paths
