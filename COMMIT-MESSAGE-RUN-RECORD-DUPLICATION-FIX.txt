fix: prevent duplicate run records during metrics updates

- Fixed critical issue in airtableService.updateClientRun where new records were
  being created instead of finding existing ones
- Added proper record lookup before creating new run records
- Added missing runIdUtils import to airtableService.js
- Confirmed client ID prefix handling working correctly in normalizeRunId

This addresses the issue where multiple run records were being created for the
same operation, leading to fragmented metrics and confusion in the tracking
system. The system now properly searches for existing records before creating
new ones.
