# TASK: Audit and Consolidate Task Management Docs

## Description
The repo contains overlapping task management files (`MASTER-TASKS.md`, `Multi-Tenant-Migration-Tasks.md`). The goal is to merge these into a single, comprehensive guide (`PROJECT-MANAGEMENT-COMPLETE-GUIDE.md`) and remove redundant files.

## Checklist
- [ ] Review content of both task management files
- [ ] Merge all relevant tasks/issues into `PROJECT-MANAGEMENT-COMPLETE-GUIDE.md`
- [ ] Remove/deprecate the old files after migration
- [ ] Update references throughout the repo
- [ ] Announce/document the new location for team
