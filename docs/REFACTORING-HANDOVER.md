# Refactoring Handover Document

## Project: PB-Webhook-Server

**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Branch:** feature/clean-service-boundaries

## Overview

We are refactoring the PB-Webhook-Server project to establish cleaner service boundaries, improve code maintainability, and enhance the multi-tenant architecture. This document summarizes what has been accomplished so far and outlines the next steps.

## What We've Done

1. **Unified Constants Approach**
   - Created centralized constants for Airtable field names
   - Replaced hardcoded field names with references to these constants
   - Implemented in multiple services including `jobOrchestrationService.js`

2. **Field Name Standardization**
   - Refactored `apiAndJobRoutes.js` to use the constant-based approach
   - Improved consistency in how we reference Airtable fields

3. **Validation Improvements**
   - Added `createValidatedObject` pattern to validate data before sending to services
   - Enhanced error handling and data integrity checks

4. **Fixed Duplicate Constant Declarations**
   - Resolved duplicate `STATUS_VALUES` declarations across multiple files
   - Standardized imports to use the unified constants file
   - Fixed the error: "Identifier 'STATUS_VALUES' has already been declared"
   - Updated files to use the centralized constants from `airtableUnifiedConstants.js`

## Current Status

We're incrementally working through the codebase to:
1. Replace hardcoded field references with constants
2. Improve service boundary definitions
3. Standardize validation and error handling
4. Enhance multi-tenant isolation
5. Consolidate duplicate constant declarations

## Recent Fixes (October 2, 2025)

1. **Fixed duplicate STATUS_VALUES declarations**
   - Removed redundant `STATUS_VALUES` declaration in `utils/airtableFieldValidator.js`
   - Updated `services/jobTracking.js` to import `STATUS_VALUES` only from unified constants
   - Fixed `services/runRecordAdapterSimple.js` to avoid duplicate imports
   - Updated `scripts/smart-resume-client-by-client.js` to use the correct constants file
   - Fixed `postBatchScorer.js` to avoid duplicate constant declarations

2. **Service Boundary Improvements**
   - Ensured all services are using the same constants source
   - Prevented circular dependencies by removing duplicate declarations
   - Standardized on `airtableUnifiedConstants.js` as the single source of truth

3. **Error Resolution**
   - Fixed the server startup errors reported in the Render logs
   - Resolved the "Identifier 'STATUS_VALUES' has already been declared" error
   - This should allow all routes to mount correctly now

## Next Steps

1. **Continue Refactoring Services**
   - Identify remaining services with hardcoded field references
   - Apply consistent patterns across all services

2. **Testing**
   - Ensure refactoring doesn't break existing functionality
   - Verify multi-tenant isolation is maintained
   - Confirm that the server starts without errors

3. **Documentation**
   - Update relevant documentation to reflect new patterns
   - Document service boundaries more explicitly

## Approach Guidelines

1. **No Bandaids**
   - Avoid quick fixes that don't address underlying architectural issues
   - Focus on proper service boundaries and clean interfaces

2. **No Over-Complications**
   - Keep the solution straightforward and maintainable
   - Prioritize readability and consistency over clever implementations

3. **Multi-Tenant First**
   - All changes must respect and enhance the multi-tenant architecture
   - Client isolation remains a top priority

4. **Consistent Patterns**
   - Use established patterns like constants for field names
   - Follow validation approaches consistently across the codebase
   - Maintain a single source of truth for constants

## Files Modified

1. Previously:
   - `jobOrchestrationService.js`
   - `routes/apiAndJobRoutes.js`

2. Recently Updated:
   - `services/jobTracking.js`
   - `utils/airtableFieldValidator.js`
   - `services/runRecordAdapterSimple.js`
   - `scripts/smart-resume-client-by-client.js`
   - `postBatchScorer.js`

## Next Files to Review

1. `leadService.js` - Check for hardcoded field references
2. `clientService.js` - Verify proper multi-tenant isolation
3. `batchScorer.js` - Ensure consistent field referencing
