# normalizedRunId is not defined Fix Documentation

## Issue Summary

We encountered an error in the client processing code where multiple clients were failing with the error:
```
[CLIENT:Dean-Hobin] [SESSION:unknown] [ERROR] Failed to process client Dean-Hobin: normalizedRunId is not defined
[CLIENT:Guy-Wilson] [SESSION:unknown] [ERROR] Failed to process client Guy-Wilson: normalizedRunId is not defined
```

This error was preventing proper processing of certain clients, causing their data to be skipped in batch processing runs.

## Root Cause Analysis

The root cause was identified as a combination of two issues:

1. **Parameter Order Mismatch**: In the `fire-and-forget-endpoint.js` file, the call to `postBatchScorer.runMultiTenantPostScoring()` was passing parameters in the incorrect order:

```javascript
// INCORRECT: Parameters in wrong order
postBatchScorer.runMultiTenantPostScoring(
  vertexAIClient,
  geminiModelId,
  client.clientId,  // This was incorrectly passed as runId
  options.limit,    // This was incorrectly passed as clientId
  { ... }
);
```

According to the function definition in `postBatchScorer.js`, the correct order is:

```javascript
async function runMultiTenantPostScoring(geminiClient, geminiModelId, runId, clientId = null, limit = null, options = {})
```

2. **Scope and Initialization Issue**: The variable `normalizedRunId` was being used in the client processing loop before it was initialized. The initialization was happening much later in the function, causing the "normalizedRunId is not defined" error.

## Fix Implementation

The fix was implemented in two key parts:

### 1. Parameter Order Correction in fire-and-forget-endpoint.js

```javascript
// FIXED: Proper parameter order
postBatchScorer.runMultiTenantPostScoring(
  vertexAIClient,
  geminiModelId,
  jobId,           // Now correctly passing jobId as runId
  client.clientId,  // Now correctly passing clientId as clientId
  options.limit,
  { ... }
);
```

### 2. Early Initialization of normalizedRunId in postBatchScorer.js

Added initialization of `normalizedRunId` at the beginning of the `runMultiTenantPostScoring` function:

```javascript
// FIX: Initialize normalizedRunId at the beginning of the function
let normalizedRunId;
try {
    normalizedRunId = unifiedRunIdService.normalizeRunId(runId);
} catch (error) {
    // Fallback to original runId if normalization fails
    normalizedRunId = runId;
}
```

Additionally, we added a defensive check before using `normalizedRunId`:

```javascript
// FIX: Added defensive check to ensure normalizedRunId is always defined
if (!normalizedRunId) {
    clientLogger.warn(`normalizedRunId was undefined, using fallback runId: ${runId}`);
    normalizedRunId = runId;
}
```

## Lessons Learned & Best Practices

1. **Parameter Order Validation**: When calling functions with multiple parameters, especially ones with similar types (like multiple string IDs), always verify the parameter order against the function definition.

2. **Variable Scope Awareness**: Be careful with variable initialization and scope, especially in large functions. Variables should be initialized before use and as close to the beginning of their scope as possible.

3. **Defensive Programming**: Always include defensive checks for critical variables, especially when they might be undefined or null. This helps prevent cascading failures.

4. **Single Source of Truth**: Variables like `runId` and `normalizedRunId` should be properly normalized and validated at the entry point of the function to ensure consistency throughout.

## Future Prevention

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Consider using named parameters (object destructuring) instead of positional parameters for complex function calls.

2. Add JSDoc comments with clear parameter descriptions to all functions.

3. Implement static analysis tools to catch undefined variable usage.

4. Consider refactoring very large functions into smaller, more focused functions with clearer responsibility boundaries.

5. Add unit tests that specifically test error handling paths, including cases where parameters might be missing or in the wrong order.
