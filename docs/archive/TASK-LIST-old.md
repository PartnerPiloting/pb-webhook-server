## Critical Issues Requiring Investigation üö®

### AI Scoring Failures for Complex Lead Profiles - PRODUCTION ISSUE IDENTIFIED
- [ ] **Issue**: Consistent scoring failures for specific leads (e.g., recHkqPSMfdQWyqus)
  - [ ] **Root Cause Identified**: Complex/large profile data causes Gemini AI to generate malformed JSON responses
  - [ ] **Investigation Status**: Extensive testing completed - confirmed NOT a batch vs individual scoring issue
  - [ ] **Current Impact**: ~10 leads consistently fail scoring attempts, remain in "To Be Scored" status
  - [ ] **Failed Solutions**:
    - ‚ùå dirty-json library: Cannot repair the specific JSON corruption patterns from AI
    - ‚ùå Response cleaning improvements: Issue occurs at AI generation level, not parsing
    - ‚ùå Individual vs batch processing: Fails consistently regardless of processing method
  
  **Technical Analysis**:
  - [ ] **Profile Data Characteristics**: Very large LinkedIn profiles (20K+ characters JSON)
  - [ ] **AI Behavior**: Gemini appears to hit internal limits and truncates/corrupts JSON mid-generation
  - [ ] **Error Pattern**: Broken JSON structure, not simple formatting issues
  - [ ] **Scope**: Affects ~10% of Guy-Wilson client leads with comprehensive LinkedIn data
  
  **üö® CRITICAL DISCOVERY - August 4, 2025**:
  - [ ] **Production vs Local Discrepancy**: EXACT same code works locally but fails in production
    - ‚úÖ **Local Environment**: Same lead (recHkqPSMfdQWyqus) scores successfully with 4096 tokens
    - ‚ùå **Production Environment**: Same lead fails with "JSON Parse Error at position 2486"
    - ‚è±Ô∏è **Performance Gap**: Local ~10-12 seconds, Production 28+ seconds (timeout issues)
    - üîç **Confirmed**: Issue is NOT token limits, but production environment constraints
  
  **Environment-Specific Issues Identified**:
  - [ ] **Render Resource Constraints**: Memory/CPU limits causing response truncation
  - [ ] **Network Timeouts**: Production API calls timing out mid-response
  - [ ] **Resource Pressure**: Gemini API responses incomplete due to server load
  - [ ] **Environment Variables**: Potential differences between local and production configs
  
  **Potential Solutions to Research**:
  - [ ] **Option 1**: Increase Gemini maxOutputTokens beyond current 4096 limit (may help with resource pressure)
  - [ ] **Option 2**: Upgrade Render service plan for more resources
  - [ ] **Option 3**: Implement timeout/retry mechanisms for partial responses
  - [ ] **Option 4**: Optimize memory usage during AI calls
  - [ ] **Option 5**: Profile data preprocessing to reduce complexity
  
  **Next Steps**:
  - [ ] **Priority 1**: Test increased token limits in production environment
  - [ ] **Priority 2**: Analyze Render resource usage during API calls
  - [ ] **Priority 3**: Compare production vs local environment configurations
  - [ ] **Priority 4**: Implement production monitoring for timeout detection
  
  **Evidence**:
  - Production Error: `"error": "singleScorer: JSON Parse Error: Expected double-quoted property name in JSON at position 2486"`
  - Local Success: Same lead produces valid 1255-character JSON response
  - Performance: Local 10s vs Production 28s response times
  
  **Priority**: CRITICAL - Production environment issue affecting client data quality

## High Priority Tasks üî•

### Post Scoring Content Display Fix
- [ ] **Fix "Top Scoring Post" empty content issue**
  - [ ] Problem: Occasional empty Content and URL in "Top Scoring Post" field despite valid post data
  - [ ] Root cause: URL matching failure between AI response and original post data during merge
  - [ ] **Solution Option 1 (Low Risk)**: Implement normalized URL comparison
    - Add `normalizeUrl()` function to handle protocol/www/trailing slash differences
    - Update URL matching logic in `postBatchScorer.js` lines 425-435
    - Minimal code change, preserves existing flow
  - [ ] **Solution Option 2 (Safety Net)**: Fallback lookup from Posts Content field
    - Only triggers when current method fails (missing content)
    - Re-reads "Posts Content" field and finds post by normalized URL
    - Keeps existing logic intact while fixing edge cases
  - [ ] **Testing Strategy**: Test with one client first, monitor logs, compare success rates
  - [ ] **Priority**: Medium-High (affects user experience but system mostly works)

### Bonus Points System Implementation
- [ ] **Phase 1: Frontend UX for Bonus Points**
  - [ ] Add "Bonus Points" Yes/No checkbox to attribute editing interface
  - [ ] Update attribute library view to show bonus point indicators
  - [ ] Implement UI validation and user experience flow
  - [ ] **Backend Decision**: Bonus points get 25% added to denominator
  - [ ] **Implementation Strategy**: Don't touch backend scoring initially - focus on UX first
  - [ ] Test frontend changes before any backend modifications

  - [ ] Frontend Load More button UI components 
  - [ ] Test pagination across all lead search/filter scenarios
  - [ ] Verify infinite scroll behavior and performance
  - [ ] Documentation update for Load More UX patterns
- [ ] **Referenced in**: `PAGINATION-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` - comprehensive implementation guide
- [ ] **Current Status**: Backend ready, frontend Load More buttons may need completion

### Custom Monitoring & Alerting System üìä
- [ ] **Phase 1: Basic Monitoring Infrastructure**
  - [ ] Implement Render Logs API integration for automated log monitoring
  - [ ] Create `/api/monitor/all-clients` endpoint for client health tracking
  - [ ] Build `/api/monitor/client/:id` endpoint for individual client status
  - [ ] Set up background monitoring processes with configurable intervals
- [ ] **Phase 2: Email Alert System**
  - [ ] Implement nodemailer-based email alerting for critical issues
  - [ ] Create configurable alert rules per client (error thresholds, timeout detection)
  - [ ] Build client-specific notification preferences and contact lists
  - [ ] Add alert escalation and frequency management
- [ ] **Phase 3: Real-time Dashboard**
  - [ ] Create `/monitor` route with Chart.js visualizations for client health
  - [ ] Implement real-time client status indicators and error tracking
  - [ ] Build historical performance graphs and trend analysis
  - [ ] Add client comparison views and system-wide health overview
- [ ] **Phase 4: Advanced Alerting**
  - [ ] Implement Slack webhook integration for team notifications
  - [ ] Add SMS alerting via Twilio for critical system failures
  - [ ] Create intelligent alert grouping and noise reduction
  - [ ] Build alert acknowledgment and resolution tracking
- [ ] **Estimated Implementation Time**: 
  - Phase 1-2: 30-60 minutes (basic monitoring + email alerts)
  - Phase 3-4: 2-3 hours (dashboard + advanced features)
- [ ] **Benefits**: Zero ongoing costs, multi-tenant specific features, full customization vs BetterStack subscription

### Multi-Client Expansion
- [ ] **Create client template base** from cleaned Guy Wilson base
- [ ] **Add new client** (when ready):
  - Add record to "Clients" master base
