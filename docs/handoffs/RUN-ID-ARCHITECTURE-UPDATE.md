# Run ID Architecture Update (2025-10-03)

## Core Changes

We've implemented a strict single-source-of-truth pattern for run IDs to eliminate issues with inconsistent run ID handling that were causing "job tracking record not found" errors.

## Key Files Modified

1. **services/unifiedRunIdService.js**:
   - Added STRICT_RUN_ID_MODE to enforce proper run ID handling
   - Enhanced normalizeRunId to preserve compound run IDs (baseId-clientId format)
   - Added detailed error logging with stack traces

2. **routes/apifyProcessRoutes.js**:
   - Updated processAllClientsInBackground to preserve parent run IDs
   - Enhanced processClientHandler to prioritize specific run IDs
   - Added detailed logging of the run ID flow

3. **services/jobTracking.js**:
   - Updated standardizeRunId to preserve compound run IDs
   - Added special handling for client-specific run ID components

4. **routes/apiAndJobRoutes.js**:
   - Updated lead scoring entry point to use parent run IDs directly
   - Removed unnecessary normalization steps

5. **scripts/smart-resume-client-by-client.js**:
   - Enhanced getNormalizedRunId to preserve original run IDs
   - Added special handling for compound run IDs

6. **routes/apifyWebhookRoutes.js**:
   - Updated webhook handling to maintain consistent run IDs
   - Improved validation and error handling

## Testing

To test these changes:

1. Run the Smart Resume process to generate parent run IDs
2. Verify that child processes receive and use the exact same run ID
3. Check webhook processing to ensure run IDs are preserved
4. Monitor for "job tracking record not found" errors - they should be eliminated

## Future Improvements

- Add automated tests for run ID consistency
- Implement monitoring for run ID verification
- Create a dedicated API endpoint for validating run ID correctness
