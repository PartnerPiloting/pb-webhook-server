# Commit Message: Implement Strict Run ID Standardization System

## Description
This commit implements a comprehensive run ID standardization system to address the root cause of "Job tracking record not found" errors. By enforcing strict validation and providing source-aware error tracking, this solution ensures consistent run ID handling across the entire application.

## Changes
- Enhanced unifiedRunIdService.js with strict validation and source tracking
- Updated JobTracking methods (getJobById, createJob, updateAggregateMetrics) to use consistent validation
- Added diagnostic API endpoints for run ID testing and validation
- Created detailed documentation of the standardization system

## Problem Solved
This addresses the following errors in production logs:
- "Job tracking record not found for run ID" 
- "Error updating aggregate metrics"
- "Failed to process client: normalizedRunId is not defined"

## Technical Details
- Added validateRunId function to enforce proper ID format
- Added source parameter to all run ID operations for better error tracking
- Implemented diagnostic routes for developer testing
- Created comprehensive documentation in docs/RUN-ID-STANDARDIZATION-IMPLEMENTATION.md

## Testing
The implementation has been tested with various run ID formats to ensure proper validation and error reporting. The diagnostic endpoints allow further testing and verification in development environments.
