# Fix Root Causes in Run Record System 

This commit builds on our previous fixes by addressing several critical root causes in the run record system, focusing on preventing duplicate creation attempts, validating record existence, proper error handling, and field name consistency.

## Root Causes Fixed

1. **Duplicate Creation Attempts**: Added a tracking system to prevent multiple creation attempts across different code paths
2. **Record Validation**: Added explicit validation that records exist before attempting updates
3. **Error Handling**: Improved webhook error handling when records don't exist
4. **Field Name Consistency**: Replaced hardcoded field names with constants from airtableFields.js
5. **Creation in Update Paths**: Removed all code paths that might create records during updates

## Key Changes

1. In `runRecordAdapterSimple.js`:
   - Added tracking for creation attempts with TTL
   - Enhanced createJobRecord with validation
   - Added detailed success/failure information

2. In `jobTracking.js`:
   - Removed createIfMissing option from updateClientRun
   - Added checkClientRunExists helper function
   - Added record existence validation to completeClientProcessing
   - Added record existence validation to updateClientMetrics
   - Replaced hardcoded field names with constants

3. In `apifyWebhookRoutes.js`:
   - Added validateRunRecordExists helper function
   - Enhanced webhook handler to check for existing records
   - Improved error responses for missing records

These changes significantly enhance the robustness of the run record system by ensuring proper validation and preventing the most common failure scenarios.
