# Smart Resume System Debugging & Fixes - Project Summary

## Problem Statement
We've been implementing a Smart Resume system with background processing capabilities that was experiencing timeout issues during cron job execution. We needed to:

1. Implement a fire-and-forget architecture to prevent HTTP timeouts
2. Add process tracking and status monitoring 
3. Add termination capabilities for stuck processes
4. Add stale lock detection to auto-recover from crashes

## Implementation Summary

### What We've Done
1. ‚úÖ Added configurable lock timeout (`SMART_RESUME_LOCK_TIMEOUT_HOURS`, default 3.5h)
2. ‚úÖ Implemented enhanced termination system with global tracking
3. ‚úÖ Added status endpoint (`/debug-smart-resume-status`)
4. ‚úÖ Created test script (`test-smart-resume-termination.js`)
5. ‚úÖ Added comprehensive documentation (`docs/SMART-RESUME-PROCESS-MANAGEMENT.md`)
6. ‚úÖ Created log analysis scripts for debugging

### Previous Issue Identified and Fixed
After deploying to staging, we found that while HTTP requests were successful, the Smart Resume background process wasn't running. We identified the issue:

```
Error: Smart resume module does not export runSmartResume function
```

The root cause was a mismatch between how our code tries to use the Smart Resume module and how it was actually structured. Our implementation expected:

```javascript
// Expected module export format
module.exports = { runSmartResume: function() {...} }
```

But the module had a different export structure.

## Current Status
The Smart Resume core functionality has been fixed with commit `a937051` and is now working correctly. We've made several key fixes:

1. Fixed module exports in the Smart Resume script to properly expose both `main` and `runSmartResume` functions
2. Fixed the heartbeatInterval scope issue that was causing an unhandled promise rejection
3. Fixed lead scoring background process by correcting function import (it was importing `getAllActiveClients` but trying to use `getActiveClientsByStream`)
4. Enhanced the `setJobStatus` function to handle null clientId values used for global operations instead of throwing errors

Tests confirm that:
- The Smart Resume process now runs successfully and completes without errors
- The post harvesting functionality is working correctly
- Lead scoring should now be fixed and process new leads correctly

There are still some minor improvements that could be made to the email reporting to provide more detailed breakdowns of operations per client.

### Latest Fix Applied
We've modified the code to be more flexible about function names and add better diagnostics:

```javascript
// Updated code with diagnostics and multiple function name support
console.log(`üîç DIAGNOSTIC: Module type: ${typeof smartResumeModule}`);
console.log(`üîç DIAGNOSTIC: Module exports:`, Object.keys(smartResumeModule || {}));

// Check what function is available and use the right one
if (typeof smartResumeModule === 'function') {
    console.log(`üîç [${jobId}] Module is a direct function, calling it...`);
    await smartResumeModule(stream);
} else if (typeof smartResumeModule.runSmartResume === 'function') {
    console.log(`üîç [${jobId}] Found runSmartResume function, calling it...`);
    await smartResumeModule.runSmartResume(stream);
} else if (typeof smartResumeModule.main === 'function') {
    console.log(`üîç [${jobId}] Found main function, calling it...`);
    await smartResumeModule.main(stream);
} else {
    console.error(`‚ùå [${jobId}] CRITICAL: No usable function found in module`);
    console.error(`‚ùå [${jobId}] Available exports:`, Object.keys(smartResumeModule || {}));
    throw new Error('Smart resume module does not export a usable function');
}
```

This change has been pushed to staging and we're testing it now.

## API Endpoints

### Start a Smart Resume Job
```bash
curl -X POST 'https://pb-webhook-server-staging.onrender.com/smart-resume-client-by-client' \
  -H 'x-webhook-secret: Diamond9753!!@@pb' \
  -H 'x-client-id: Guy-Wilson' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"stream": 1, "leadScoringLimit": 5}'
```

### Check Status
```bash
curl -X GET 'https://pb-webhook-server-staging.onrender.com/debug-smart-resume-status' \
  -H 'x-webhook-secret: Diamond9753!!@@pb'
```

### Reset/Terminate Process
```bash
curl -X POST 'https://pb-webhook-server-staging.onrender.com/reset-smart-resume-lock' \
  -H 'x-webhook-secret: Diamond9753!!@@pb' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"forceTerminate": true}'
```

## Testing Tools
1. `test-smart-resume-termination.js` - Tests the termination functionality
2. `analyze-smart-resume-logs.js` - Analyzes logs for Smart Resume issues
3. `check-smart-resume-logs.js` - Continuous monitoring of logs

## Current Testing Status
We're testing the latest fix on staging to see if the diagnostic logs reveal what function names are available in the module and if our more flexible approach allows the process to start correctly.

## Next Steps
1. Check logs for diagnostic messages showing module structure
2. Based on those logs, we may need to adjust which function name we call
3. Once working, add the environment variable to Render settings
4. Consider adding regular health checks
