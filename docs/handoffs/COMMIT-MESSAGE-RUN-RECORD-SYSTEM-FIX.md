# Fix Run Record System Root Causes

## Summary
This commit addresses multiple root causes of issues in the run record system, focusing on parameter validation, field name consistency, and proper error handling throughout the codebase.

## Root Causes Fixed
1. **Object Parameters Issue**: Fixed "[object Object]" errors by adding validation at function entry points
2. **Variable Scope Issues**: Fixed "normalizedRunId is not defined" by ensuring proper scope
3. **Field Name Inconsistencies**: Created constants for Airtable field names
4. **Incomplete Refactoring**: Completed unfinished code in services
5. **Missing Validation**: Added robust parameter checking at all entry points

## Changes
- Created `utils/parameterValidator.js` for centralized parameter validation
- Created `constants/airtableFields.js` for field name constants
- Fixed `services/apifyRunsService.js` syntax errors
- Added `getNormalizedRunId` helper in `smart-resume-client-by-client.js`
- Enhanced `StructuredLogger` constructor with validation
- Added validation to `completeClientRun` function
- Added `safeAccess.js` utility for safe object property access
- Standardized field names across client run records

## Impact
These changes significantly improve the robustness of the run record system by:
- Preventing cryptic "[object Object]" errors in logs and databases
- Ensuring consistent field names across the application
- Adding proper validation at all entry points
- Making the code more maintainable with centralized validation
