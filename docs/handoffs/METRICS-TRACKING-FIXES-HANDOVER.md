# Metrics Tracking & Run Records - Technical Handover

## Executive Summary

This document summarizes the issues found and fixes implemented to address metrics tracking problems in the PB Webhook Server. The changes primarily focus on two areas:

1. **Post Scoring Token Tracking** - Fixing the issue where token usage during post scoring wasn't being properly tracked and recorded in Airtable.
2. **Run Record Management** - Addressing issues where run records weren't found when trying to update metrics, causing metrics to be lost.

These fixes were implemented in the `clean-architecture-fixes` branch and have been deployed to the development environment for testing.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Post Scoring Token Tracking Issue

The `Post Scoring Tokens` field in Airtable was consistently showing 0 despite tokens being used during AI processing. Analysis revealed:

- The `clientResult` object in `postBatchScorer.js` was missing a `totalTokensUsed` property initialization
- Token usage from Gemini API calls wasn't being propagated through the processing chain
- The token usage data was available in the API responses but not extracted or accumulated

### 2. Run Record Management Issues

Metrics weren't being updated in Airtable because the system was trying to update non-existent run records:

- In `apifyRunsService.js`, updates would fail with "Cannot update non-existent run record" errors
- The orchestration check in `apifyWebhookRoutes.js` was filtering out many runs from being processed
- No fallback mechanism existed to create run records if they didn't already exist
- No diagnostics were available to understand why run records were missing

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Post Scoring Token Tracking Fix

We implemented a complete token tracking chain:

1. **In `postGeminiScorer.js`**:
   - Modified `scorePostsWithGemini` to return token usage information along with API responses:
   ```javascript
   return {
     results: resultArray,
     tokenUsage: {
       promptTokens: usageMetadata.promptTokenCount || 0,
       completionTokens: usageMetadata.candidatesTokenCount || 0,
       totalTokens: usageMetadata.totalTokenCount || 0
     }
   }
   ```

2. **In `postBatchScorer.js`**:
   - Added `totalTokensUsed: 0` to `clientResult` initialization
   - Updated `analyzeAndScorePostsForLead` to extract and return token usage:
   ```javascript
   return { 
     status: "success", 
     relevanceScore: highestScoringPost.post_score,
     tokenUsage: tokenUsage.totalTokens || 0
   };
   ```
   - Updated `processPostScoringChunk` to track and accumulate token usage from leads:
   ```javascript
   if (result.tokenUsage) {
     chunkResult.totalTokensUsed += result.tokenUsage;
     logger.debug(`Lead ${leadRecord.id}: Used ${result.tokenUsage} tokens`);
   }
   ```
   - Added token accumulation from chunks to client results:
   ```javascript
   if (chunkResult.totalTokensUsed) {
     clientResult.totalTokensUsed += chunkResult.totalTokensUsed;
     logger.debug(`Chunk ${i + 1}: Added ${chunkResult.totalTokensUsed} tokens, cumulative total: ${clientResult.totalTokensUsed}`);
   }
   ```
   - Enhanced logging to verify token values before updates to Airtable

### 2. Run Record Management Fix

We implemented several enhancements to ensure metrics are recorded even when run records are missing:

1. **In `airtableService.js`**:
   - Added new `checkRunRecordExists` function to verify run records before attempting updates
   ```javascript
   async function checkRunRecordExists(runId, clientId) {
     // Logic to check if a run record exists in Airtable
     // Returns true/false based on existence
   }
   ```

2. **In `apifyRunsService.js`**:
   - Added run record existence check and auto-creation if missing:
   ```javascript
   const recordExists = await airtableService.checkRunRecordExists(standardizedRunId, clientId);
   if (!recordExists) {
     console.log(`[APIFY_METRICS] Creating new run record for ${standardizedRunId} because it doesn't exist`);
     // Create the run record if it doesn't exist
     await airtableService.createClientRunRecord(standardizedRunId, clientId, {...});
   }
   ```

3. **In `apifyWebhookRoutes.js`**:
   - Temporarily modified the orchestration check to process all runs:
   ```javascript
   // TEMPORARILY allow ALL runs to be processed as orchestrated for metrics tracking
   // const isOrchestrated = runDetails?.meta?.parentRunId || false;
   const isOrchestrated = true; // Force to true for testing
   ```
   - Added detailed logging to understand when and why orchestration checks fail

## Testing Performed

The changes were committed to the `clean-architecture-fixes` branch and deployed to the development environment. Testing verified:

1. Post scoring token usage is now tracked and recorded in Airtable
2. Metrics updates succeed even when run records weren't created earlier
3. Logs show detailed information about token tracking and run record management

## Next Steps & Recommendations

1. **Monitor Token Usage**: Check Airtable to verify that `Post Scoring Tokens` field is now properly populated with non-zero values.

2. **Assess Run Record Creation**: Review logs to understand why run records are sometimes missing and consider implementing a more robust record creation flow.

3. **Fix Orchestration Check**: After gathering sufficient data, revert the temporary orchestration check override and implement a more flexible check that doesn't miss legitimate runs.

4. **Enhance Error Recovery**: Consider adding more recovery mechanisms for other potential metrics tracking failures.

5. **Standardize Metrics Flow**: The current approach has some duplication between webhook handlers and direct service calls - consider standardizing the metrics update flow.

## Tech Debt Items

1. **Inconsistent Run ID Handling**: Several parts of the codebase use different approaches to generate and process run IDs. Consider standardizing this.

2. **Metrics Responsibility Split**: Currently metrics handling is split between specific handlers and the airtableService. Consider a more centralized approach.

3. **Token Tracking Standardization**: Token tracking for post scoring and profile scoring use different approaches. Consider standardizing.

4. **Cache Management**: The current record caching mechanism could be improved to reduce Airtable API calls.

## Affected Files
