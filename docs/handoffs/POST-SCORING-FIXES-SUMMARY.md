# Post Scoring Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified
1. Filter formula in `postBatchScorer.js` may have had similar single-quotes vs double-quotes issue as the lead scoring feature
2. Lack of sufficient debug logging to track the flow of post scoring, especially for the Guy Wilson client
3. Potential issues with the view-based detection of unscored posts in client bases

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Filter Formula Syntax
- Ensured consistent use of single quotes in Airtable filter formulas in `postBatchScorer.js`

### 2. Added Enhanced Debug Logging
- Added special debugging focus for the Guy Wilson client to track its processing
- Added detailed logging about leads with posts found for scoring
- Added informative messages when no posts are found to score
- Improved logging for the client job status checks

### 3. Created Testing Documentation
- Created a comprehensive test plan in `POST-SCORING-TEST-PLAN.md`
- Outlined steps to verify post scoring for Guy Wilson client
- Provided troubleshooting guidance for common issues

## Next Steps
1. Commit these changes to the repository
2. Run the test plan to verify post scoring is now working for Guy Wilson client
3. Monitor logs to see if the debug messages help identify any remaining issues
