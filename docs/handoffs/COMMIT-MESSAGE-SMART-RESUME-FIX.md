# Add missing updateAggregateMetrics method to JobTracking class

## Issue Fixed
- Smart Resume process was failing with error: "Required JobTracking methods not found: updateAggregateMetrics"
- This method was expected by the Smart Resume module but was not implemented in the JobTracking class

## Changes Made
- Added updateAggregateMetrics method to JobTracking class in services/jobTracking.js
- Method follows existing patterns for consistent parameter handling, error management, and field validation
- Implements proper aggregation of numerical fields and handling of system notes

## Testing
- Fix to be verified in online environment with Smart Resume process

This commit aligns with the clean service boundaries initiative by ensuring that the JobTracking service properly implements all methods required by its consumers.
