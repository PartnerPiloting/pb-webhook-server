# Run Record Recovery and Dependency Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Run Record Creation Failures
- **Root Cause**: Missing clientName values in recovery paths causing "clientName is not defined" errors
- **Fixed By**: 
  - Added 'run_record_recovery' to allowedSources array in createClientRunRecord
  - Enhanced updateRunRecord function with recovery path similar to completeRunRecord
  - Both functions now use clientId as fallback for clientName when creating recovery records

### 2. Express-Rate-Limit Dependency Issue
- **Root Cause**: While express-rate-limit is in package.json (^8.1.0), it may not be installed on the server
- **Fixed By**: 
  - Created trigger-redeploy.js to force a redeployment on Render
  - The redeployment will automatically run npm install, resolving the dependency issue

### 3. Post Harvesting Authentication Issue (Pending Investigation)
- **Symptoms**: HTML responses instead of JSON
- **Next Steps**:
  - Need to verify that POST requests include proper authentication headers
  - Check routes/apifyWebhookRoutes.js for authentication handling
  - Examine express-rate-limit configuration for potential issues

## Deployment Instructions

1. Commit and push these changes to the staging branch:
   ```bash
   git add services/runRecordServiceV2.js trigger-redeploy.js COMMIT-MESSAGE-RECOVERY-PATH-FIX.md
   git commit -F COMMIT-MESSAGE-RECOVERY-PATH-FIX.md
   git push origin staging
   ```

2. Monitor logs for:
   - Absence of "clientName is not defined" errors
   - Successful loading of all routes (specifically apifyWebhookRoutes.js)
   - Proper JSON responses (not HTML) for post harvesting requests

3. For further investigation of HTML responses:
   - Check request headers for proper authentication
   - Verify express-rate-limit configuration
   - Look for any middleware that might be causing HTML responses instead of JSON

## Next Steps

1. Once staging has been verified, merge these changes to production.
2. Review other parts of the system that might be affected by similar issues.
3. Add more comprehensive error handling in client run record creation code paths.
4. Consider implementing a health check endpoint that verifies middleware is correctly loaded.
