# Run ID System Improvements

## Summary
We've implemented a strict single-source-of-truth pattern for run IDs to resolve the "Job tracking record not found" errors. This document outlines the changes made and provides guidance for testing and monitoring.

## Key Changes

1. **Strict Run ID Generation**
   - Removed the legacy `generateRunId()` function in favor of direct `generateTimestampRunId()` usage
   - Implemented an error-throwing version of `generateRunId()` to identify remaining legacy code

2. **Improved Normalization**
   - Updated `normalizeRunId()` to preserve compound IDs (format: baseId-clientId)
   - Enhanced error handling for null/undefined run IDs

3. **Better Error Diagnostics**
   - Added detailed logging for "record not found" errors
   - Included comparison with recent job records for troubleshooting
   - Added stack traces to error logs

4. **Consistency Testing**
   - Created a test script to verify run ID consistency (`test-run-id-consistency.js`)
   - Tests basic generation, normalization, compound IDs, and error handling

## Monitoring Recommendations

1. **Watch for Deprecation Errors**
   - Monitor logs for "DEPRECATED: generateRunId() has been removed" messages
   - These indicate remaining legacy code that needs to be updated

2. **Track "Record Not Found" Errors**
   - These should now include more diagnostic information
   - Look for patterns in the enhanced error logs (originalRunId vs standardizedRunId differences)

3. **Run the Consistency Test**
   - Periodically run `node test-run-id-consistency.js`
   - Verify that "ALL TESTS PASSED" is displayed

## Validation Steps

1. **Test Key Job Flows**
   - Run Apify integration jobs
   - Check Smart Resume processing
   - Verify client-specific processing

2. **Check Job Tracking Records**
   - Confirm that job records are being correctly found
   - Verify that client run records link properly to base run records

3. **Monitor Production Logs**
   - Watch for any remaining "Job tracking record not found" errors
   - They should now contain more diagnostic information

## Future Considerations

1. **API Validation**
   - Add run ID validation on all API boundaries
   - Ensure consistent format and handling

2. **Distributed Tracing**
   - Consider adding proper distributed tracing for complex job flows
   - This would provide end-to-end visibility of run IDs across systems

3. **Automated Testing**
   - Add integration tests for the run ID system
   - Include tests in CI/CD pipeline
