# Fix Rendering Errors in Job Processing System

## Issues Fixed
1. **Assignment to constant variable error** - Fixed variable declaration in apifyProcessRoutes.js by ensuring consistent use of "let" instead of "const" for the endpoint variable in the processAllClientsInBackground function.

2. **Unknown field name: "Clients Processed" error** - Fixed Airtable field name references in jobTracking.js by:
   - Adding missing field constants to airtableSimpleConstants.js
   - Updating numericFields array in updateAggregateMetrics to use constants instead of hardcoded strings
   - Ensuring consistent field naming throughout the codebase

## Changes Made
- Updated processAllClientsInBackground function to use let for endpoint variable
- Added missing field constants in airtableSimpleConstants.js:
  - PROFILES_PROCESSED
  - PROFILES_SCORED
  - POSTS_PROCESSED
  - POSTS_SCORED
  - ERRORS
  - TOTAL_TOKENS
  - PROMPT_TOKENS
  - COMPLETION_TOKENS
  - TOTAL_POSTS_HARVESTED
- Updated updateAggregateMetrics method to use constant references instead of hardcoded strings

## Testing
These changes ensure that:
1. No "Assignment to constant variable" errors occur during process-level2-v2 execution
2. All field names used in updateAggregateMetrics correctly reference existing Airtable fields

This is part of a larger effort to standardize field names and improve code consistency.
