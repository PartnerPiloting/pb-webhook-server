# Webhook Server Project Handover - September 25, 2025

## Current Status Summary

We've been addressing issues in the webhook server's client run record tracking system. The codebase exhibits technical debt with significant architectural challenges that require both immediate fixes and long-term refactoring.

## Recent Fixes

1. **Syntax Error Fixes**
   - Fixed critical syntax errors in `routes/apifyProcessRoutes.js` involving malformed try/catch blocks
   - Created missing `services/postService.js` module that was being referenced but didn't exist

2. **Run Record Implementation Issues**
   - CRITICAL ISSUE: We discovered the "Single Creation Point" pattern was NOT actually implemented
   - Multiple places in the code are creating client run records independently:
     - `apifyProcessRoutes.js` - Post harvesting flow
     - `batchScorer.js` - Two separate places (initial setup + skipped clients)
     - `smart-resume-client-by-client.js` - In the Smart Resume workflow
   - Current prevention relies on duplicate detection in the `createClientRunRecord` function

## Known Issues

1. **Code Structure Issues**
   - Overly complex files with multiple responsibilities
   - Deeply nested error handling that's difficult to maintain
   - High coupling between components making isolated changes difficult
   - Inconsistent approach to run record creation

2. **Error Handling**
   - Some error scenarios may still not be properly handled
   - Email error reporting system needs fixing next

3. **Technical Debt**
   - Large monolithic route handlers (400+ lines)
   - Inconsistent patterns for accessing client data
   - Limited automated testing

## Agreed Action Plan

1. **IMMEDIATE PRIORITY (Next Chat)**
   - Implement true Single Creation Point pattern by:
     - Creating a proper `runRecordService.js` module
     - Centralizing all run record creation logic
     - Refactoring all existing code to use this service
     - Adding comprehensive logging for record creation tracking
   - This is now our top priority before addressing email error reporting

2. **After Run Record Service Implementation**
   - Fix the email error reporting system
   - Monitor logs to confirm fixes are working
   - Create a technical debt document listing all identified issues

3. **Mid-term Refactoring**
   - Continue incremental refactoring:
     - Extract API-specific logic to controller files
     - Improve error handling consistency
     - Address other identified technical debt items

4. **Long-term**
   - Add automated testing
   - Set up linting (ESLint) to prevent future syntax errors
   - Consider more comprehensive architectural improvements

## Key Files

- `services/airtableService.js` - Contains the createClientRunRecord function that needs refactoring
- `batchScorer.js` - Currently creates run records in two different places
- `routes/apifyProcessRoutes.js` - Creates run records for post harvesting
- `routes/apifyWebhookRoutes.js` - Processes webhooks from Apify 
- `services/postService.js` - Newly created service for post management
- `config/airtableClient.js` - Manages multi-tenant Airtable connections

## True Single Creation Point Plan

The real Single Creation Point pattern we will implement in the next chat:

1. **Create a new runRecordService.js module**
   - Move all run record CRUD operations into this dedicated service
   - Implement strict validation and logging
   - Ensure it's the only place that can interact with Client Run Results table

2. **Refactor existing code**
   - Modify all current calls to createClientRunRecord to use the new service
   - Update batchScorer.js, apifyProcessRoutes.js, and other files
   - Implement consistent error handling across all usages

3. **Add centralized tracking**
   - Create a run record registry that tracks all record creation attempts
   - Log all creation events for easier debugging
   - Implement proper lifecycle management for run records

4. **Validate implementation**
   - Test with multiple client scenarios
   - Verify no duplicate records are created
   - Ensure metrics are consistently tracked

## Multi-tenant Architecture Notes

The system uses a multi-tenant architecture where:
- Each client has their own Airtable base
- Operations must correctly resolve client context via `x-client-id` header
- Client run records track operations across all clients
- Error isolation is critical to prevent one client's issues from affecting others

## Testing Recommendations

After any changes:
1. Test with multiple client IDs to ensure multi-tenant isolation
2. Check for run record creation and updates
3. Monitor for "record not found" errors in logs
4. Verify metrics are correctly tracked

## Next Steps for Next Developer

1. Apply the agreed action plan, starting with any remaining run record tracking issues
2. Fix email error reporting next
3. Begin incremental refactoring only after operational issues are resolved
4. Consider adding automated tests before major refactoring
