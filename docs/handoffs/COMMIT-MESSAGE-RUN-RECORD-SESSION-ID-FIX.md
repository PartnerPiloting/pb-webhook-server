# Fix: Objects passed to StructuredLogger and field name inconsistencies

## Root Causes Fixed

1. **Objects passed as sessionId** - Fixed webhook handler incorrectly passing objects to the StructuredLogger constructor
   * Enhanced validation to ensure strings are passed or objects are properly converted to strings
   * Added validation at both the main webhook handler and processWebhook entry points
   * Used consistent validation pattern for all run ID parameters

2. **Inconsistent field names** - Fixed discrepancy between constants files
   * `constants/airtableFields.js` used `CLIENTS_PROCESSED: 'Clients Processed'`
   * `constants/airtableConstants.js` used `TOTAL_CLIENTS_PROCESSED: 'Total Clients Processed'`
   * Updated constants to match the correct field name in the Airtable schema

## Implementation Details

1. Added validation to `processWebhook` function:
   ```javascript
   // CRITICAL FIX: Ensure jobRunId is properly validated and used as a string in the logger
   const validJobRunId = typeof jobRunId === 'string' ? jobRunId : 
                        (jobRunId && jobRunId.runId ? jobRunId.runId : String(jobRunId));
   ```

2. Added similar validation in the main webhook handler before passing to background process:
   ```javascript
   // CRITICAL FIX: Ensure jobRunId is properly validated before passing to background process
   const validatedJobRunId = typeof jobRunId === 'string' ? jobRunId : 
                           (jobRunId && jobRunId.runId ? jobRunId.runId : String(jobRunId));
   ```

3. Updated field name constants for consistency:
   ```javascript
   CLIENTS_PROCESSED: 'Clients Processed', // Corrected field name
   CLIENTS_SUCCEEDED: 'Clients Succeeded', // Added for consistency
   CLIENTS_FAILED: 'Clients Failed', // Added for consistency
   ```

## Testing

1. This fix ensures that the "Object passed as sessionId to StructuredLogger constructor" error will no longer occur
2. Validates all object parameters that might be passed to StructuredLogger
3. Ensures consistent field names across all constants files

## Technical Notes

- The StructuredLogger already had validation code to handle objects, but objects were still being passed directly
- This change prevents passing objects altogether by validating at the entry points
- The field name inconsistency was likely causing the "Unknown field name: status" error
