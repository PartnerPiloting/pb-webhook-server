# Variable Scope Fixes & Lead Scoring Testing Summary

## Variable Scope Fixes

We identified and fixed several potential runtime errors related to variable scope in the multi-tenant lead scoring system.

### Issue Description
Variables defined inside `try` blocks were being referenced in corresponding `catch` blocks, which could lead to "undefined variable" errors if exceptions occurred before the variable declarations were reached.

### Changes Made

1. **In `routes/apiAndJobRoutes.js`:**
   ```javascript
   // BEFORE:
   try {
     console.log(`ðŸŽ¯ Processing client ${i + 1}/${clients.length}: ${client.clientName} (${client.clientId})`);
     
     // Set client status (stream already set/filtered)
     await setJobStatus(client.clientId, 'post_scoring', 'RUNNING', jobId);
     
     const clientStartTime = Date.now();
     
     // ...rest of code
   } catch (error) {
     // Handle client failure or timeout
     const clientDuration = formatDuration(Date.now() - clientStartTime); // Could be undefined!
     // ...rest of error handling
   }
   
   // AFTER:
   console.log(`ðŸŽ¯ Processing client ${i + 1}/${clients.length}: ${client.clientName} (${client.clientId})`);
   
   // Set client status (stream already set/filtered)
   await setJobStatus(client.clientId, 'post_scoring', 'RUNNING', jobId);
   
   const clientStartTime = Date.now();
   
   try {
     // ...rest of code
   } catch (error) {
     // Handle client failure or timeout
     const clientDuration = formatDuration(Date.now() - clientStartTime); // Now always defined
     // ...rest of error handling
   }
   ```

2. **Similar fix in `fire-and-forget-endpoint.js`:**
   - Moved `clientStartTime` declaration before the try block
   - Ensured error handling would always have access to the variable

### Verification
- We systematically reviewed other occurrences of similar patterns in:
  - `postBatchScorer.js`
  - Other parts of `apiAndJobRoutes.js`
  - `apifyProcessRoutes.js`
- Confirmed that other instances properly defined variables outside try-catch blocks

### Deployment
- Changes were committed with message "Fix variable scope in post scoring: Move clientStartTime before try blocks"
- Pushed to the staging branch for testing

## Lead Scoring Testing Configuration

For testing purposes, we're using the existing `LEAD_SCORING_LIMIT` environment variable to limit the number of leads processed.

### Environment Variable Details

- **Variable Name**: `LEAD_SCORING_LIMIT`
- **Current Test Value**: `5`
- **Purpose**: Limits the number of leads with "To Be Scored" status processed per client
- **Implementation**: Already properly implemented in the codebase

### Where It's Used

The limit is applied in the `fetchLeads` function in `batchScorer.js`:

```javascript
await clientBase("Leads") 
    .select({ 
        maxRecords: limit, // This uses the LEAD_SCORING_LIMIT 
        filterByFormula: filterFormula 
    }) 
    .eachPage((pageRecords, next) => {
        records.push(...pageRecords);
        next();
    })
```

### Testing Notes

- Using the Guy-Wilson client for testing
- Testing directly on the staging environment
- Environment variable should be set on the hosting platform (e.g., Render.com dashboard)
- Do not commit environment variables to the codebase

## System Context

- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Each client has its own Airtable base
- **Lead Scoring Flow**: 
  1. System finds leads with "To Be Scored" status
  2. Processes them through AI scoring (Gemini)
  3. Updates lead records with scores
- **Error Handling**: Now more robust with proper variable scoping

## Next Steps

1. Continue testing with the Guy-Wilson client using the limited batch size
2. Verify proper execution without undefined variable errors
3. Monitor logs for any remaining issues
4. Consider implementing similar variable scope checks in other parts of the system
