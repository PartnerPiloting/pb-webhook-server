# Handover Document: Run Record Service Recovery Fixes

## Issues Addressed
During this session, we fixed three critical issues in the multi-tenant LinkedIn lead management system:

1. **Missing runIdService Import** - Fixed reference error in the run record adapter
2. **Run Record Creation Failure** - Added recovery path for missing run records
3. **Identified Express Rate Limit Dependency Issue** - Needs deployment action

## Issue Details and Solutions

### 1. Missing runIdService Import

#### Problem
The runRecordAdapter.js file was attempting to use runIdService without importing it:

```
[CLIENT:Dean-Hobin] [SESSION:20250925-201849-678] [ERROR] [Adapter] Error in adaptCreateRunRecord: runIdService is not defined
```

#### Root Cause
The adapter file had a dependency on runIdService but no import statement.

#### Solution
Added the missing import statement at the top of the file:

```javascript
// runRecordAdapter.js
// Adapter to bridge from the old service to the new V2 service with Single Creation Point pattern

const runRecordServiceV2 = require('./runRecordServiceV2');
const runIdService = require('./runIdService');

// We don't need to import the original service since we're implementing all functionality directly
```

### 2. Run Record Creation Failure

#### Problem
The system was refusing to create run records when they didn't exist, causing cascading failures:

```
[ERROR] No record found for 250925-201845-Dean-Hobin. To prevent duplicate records, refusing to create a new one.
Airtable Service ERROR: Failed to update client run: [ERROR] No record found for 250925-201845-Dean-Hobin. To prevent duplicate records, refusing to create a new one.
```

#### Root Cause
The airtableService.js implementation was designed to prevent duplicate records by throwing errors when records weren't found, instead of attempting to create them. This was causing operations to fail when they should have recovered gracefully.

#### Solution
Added a recovery path in airtableService.js:

```javascript
// If not found, attempt to create a new record using runRecordServiceV2
if (!recordId) {
  try {
    console.log(`[METDEBUG] No record found for ${standardRunId}, attempting to create via runRecordServiceV2...`);
    const runRecordServiceV2 = require('./runRecordServiceV2');
    
    // Create with adapter-compatible options
    const createdRecord = await runRecordServiceV2.createClientRunRecord(
      standardRunId.split('-').slice(0, 2).join('-'), // Base run ID
      clientId, 
      clientName,
      { source: 'airtable_service_recovery' }
    );
    
    if (createdRecord && createdRecord.id) {
      console.log(`[METDEBUG] Successfully created run record via recovery path: ${createdRecord.id}`);
      recordId = createdRecord.id;
    } else {
      const errorMsg = `[ERROR] Failed to create run record for ${standardRunId} via recovery path.`;
      console.error(errorMsg);
      throw new Error(errorMsg);
    }
  } catch (createError) {
    const errorMsg = `[ERROR] No record found for ${standardRunId} and creation failed: ${createError.message}`;
    console.error(errorMsg);
    throw new Error(errorMsg);
  }
}
```

Also added the new source to the allowed sources list in runRecordServiceV2.js:

```javascript
// Only certain sources are allowed to create records
const allowedSources = ['orchestrator', 'master_process', 'smart_resume_workflow', 'batch_process', 'airtable_service_recovery'];
```

This enables a fallback mechanism that will automatically create missing run records when possible.

### 3. Express Rate Limit Dependency Issue

#### Problem
The server was failing to load the apifyWebhookRoutes due to a missing module:

```
2025-09-25T20:18:19.082251418Z index.js: Error mounting apifyWebhookRoutes Cannot find module 'express-rate-limit'
2025-09-25T20:18:19.082271988Z - /opt/render/project/src/index.js Error: Cannot find module 'express-rate-limit'
```

#### Root Cause
The express-rate-limit dependency was recently added (September 25, 2025) to the project but hasn't been properly deployed/installed on the staging server.

#### Solution
This dependency is already correctly listed in package.json. The solution is to run `npm install` on the staging server to install the missing dependency:

```bash
# Run on the staging server
npm install
```

## Additional Issue Identified

### Post Harvesting JSON Parsing Errors

#### Problem
The system is receiving HTML instead of JSON when making API calls for post_harvesting:

```
üîç SMART_RESUME_250925-201845 [2025-09-25T20:18:50.651Z] [ERROR] ‚ùå post_harvesting error for Dean-Hobin: Unexpected token '<', "<!DOCTYPE "... is not valid JSON
```

#### Root Cause
The API calls are likely receiving authentication failures or redirects to login pages instead of JSON data. This is typically caused by:
- Invalid or expired authentication tokens
- Incorrect API endpoints
- Network issues causing redirects

#### Recommended Actions
1. Check the authentication token configuration for the post_harvesting endpoint
   - Based on test-smart-resume-auth.js, it's using 'Authorization: Bearer PB_WEBHOOK_SECRET'
2. Verify that the API endpoints are correct
3. Monitor API calls with additional logging to see the full response
4. Implement retry logic with token refresh if authentication is the issue
5. Test specifically with test-post-harvesting-auth.js to isolate and fix the authentication issue

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Restart the Application:**
   ```bash
   # If using PM2
   pm2 restart all
   
   # If using standard Node
   npm start
   ```

3. **Verify Fixes:**
   - Monitor logs for any remaining runIdService reference errors
   - Check if run records are being created properly with clientId fallback
   - Verify that apifyWebhookRoutes is loading correctly with express-rate-limit

## Future Improvements

1. **Enhanced Error Handling:**
   - Add more robust error handling and recovery mechanisms
   - Implement automatic retry logic for authentication failures

2. **Better Dependency Management:**
   - Set up automatic dependency installation during deployment
   - Add dependency validation checks during startup

3. **Monitoring Improvements:**
   - Add dedicated health checks for API authentication status
   - Create metrics for tracking run record creation success rate

## Conclusion

These fixes address the immediate issues with run record creation and service stability. The changes maintain the multi-tenant isolation while adding graceful recovery paths when records are missing.

The post harvesting authentication issue requires further investigation, but the other fixes should resolve the run record and adapter reference errors completely.
