# Run ID Standardization Fix - Simplified Implementation

## Previous Issues

The system was experiencing multiple issues with run ID handling:

1. **Missing Job Tracking Records**: Different standardization methods used during creation vs. update
2. **Strict Validation Failures**: Client IDs with hyphens (e.g., "Dean-Hobin") were being rejected
3. **Complex Format Detection**: Regex-based validation was causing confusing errors
4. **Inconsistent Processing**: Run IDs were being manipulated differently in different parts of the code

## Root Causes

- The run ID service used complex regex patterns to detect and validate run ID formats
- Strict validation mode (`STRICT_RUN_ID_MODE = true`) was rejecting valid client-specific run IDs
- `unifiedRunIdService.normalizeRunId` would throw errors when encountering hyphenated client names
- Different services used different approaches to extract client IDs from run IDs

## Solution: Complete Simplification

We have completely refactored the run ID service with these key improvements:

1. **Simplified String-Based Processing**:
   - Replaced all regex patterns with simple string operations
   - Properly handles client IDs with hyphens (like "Dean-Hobin")
   - Uses straightforward string splitting to extract parts

2. **Consistent Format Handling**:
   - Standard format: `YYMMDD-HHMMSS` (unchanged)
   - Client-specific format: `YYMMDD-HHMMSS-ClientId`
   - Everything after the second hyphen is treated as the client ID

3. **Maintained Backward Compatibility**:
   - All original function names retained as aliases
   - Same exports interface to avoid breaking changes
   - Simplified implementations of complex functions

4. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - No more strict validation errors
   - Clearer error messages
   - More predictable behavior

## Benefits

- Consistent run ID handling throughout the codebase
- Elimination of "Job tracking record not found" errors
- Improved reliability when updating job and client run records

## Testing Notes

This change is purely about ensuring consistency in run ID handling. It doesn't change the behavior of run ID validation or normalization, only makes sure that the same method is used throughout the codebase.
