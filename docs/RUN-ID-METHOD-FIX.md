# Run ID Standardization Fix Documentation

## Issue Summary

We encountered a critical error in the system where multiple API endpoints were failing with the error:
```
Error creating job tracking record: standardizeRunId is not defined
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The root cause was identified as a classic scope issue in JavaScript. The `standardizeRunId` function was defined as a static method on the `JobTracking` class:

```javascript
class JobTracking {
  static standardizeRunId(runIdInput, options = {}) {
    // Implementation...
  }
}
```

However, throughout the same file, the function was being called directly without the class prefix:

```javascript
// Incorrect usage causing "standardizeRunId is not defined" error
const standardRunId = standardizeRunId(runId, { 
  enforceStandard: true,
  logErrors: true
});
```

JavaScript scope rules require static methods to be called with their class name prefix. The correct usage is:

```javascript
// Correct usage with class prefix
const standardRunId = JobTracking.standardizeRunId(runId, { 
  enforceStandard: true,
  logErrors: true
});
```

## Fix Implementation

All instances of direct `standardizeRunId()` calls in `jobTracking.js` were updated to use the proper class-prefixed method call `JobTracking.standardizeRunId()`.

This ensures that the function is properly referenced from its scope and maintains the architecture's "single source of truth" principle.

## Lessons Learned & Best Practices

1. **Class Method Consistency**: When using class methods (especially static ones), always reference them with the class name prefix.

2. **Function Scope Awareness**: Remember that in JavaScript, functions defined within a class are scoped to that class and not available globally.

3. **Self-Reference Pattern**: If a method needs to be available both as a class method and standalone function, consider:
   - Making the standalone function the primary implementation
   - Having the class method delegate to the standalone function

4. **Code Review Focus**: Pay special attention during code reviews to how methods are called versus how they're defined.

5. **Error Diagnostics**: The error message "X is not defined" usually indicates a scope issue - check if the function exists but is being called from outside its scope.

## Related Architectural Patterns

This fix aligns with our "Single Source of Truth" development philosophy by ensuring that the standardizeRunId function is consistently accessed through its proper interface (the JobTracking class).

## Future Prevention

1. Consider using a linter rule to prevent calling undefined functions
2. Add tests specifically for method invocation patterns
3. Document class method usage patterns in the codebase to maintain consistency
