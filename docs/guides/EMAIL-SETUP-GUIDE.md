```

## Production Deployment

```bash
# Cron command (already set up)
node scripts/smart-resume-client-by-client.js
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Authentication failed"**: Check app-specific password
2. **"Connection timeout"**: Verify SMTP_HOST and SMTP_PORT
3. **"Email not configured"**: Ensure all SMTP variables are set

### Debug Email Service
Check email configuration in logs:
- ‚úÖ "Email service configured successfully"
- ‚ö†Ô∏è "Email service not configured (missing SMTP credentials)"

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Add SMTP credentials to `.env` and Render
2. ‚úÖ Test email functionality locally
3. ‚úÖ Verify production email delivery
4. ‚úÖ Monitor daily cron job emails

The email reporting system is fully implemented and ready to go once SMTP credentials are configured!
