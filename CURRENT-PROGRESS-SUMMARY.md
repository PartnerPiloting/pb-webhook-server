## Issue Fixed: Run Record Duplication

We identified and resolved a critical issue in the multi-tenant LinkedIn lead management system where multiple run records were being created for the same client run in Airtable.

### Root Causes
1. Inconsistent run ID formats between different operations:
   - Standard format: `SR-250924-001-T3304-S1-CDean-Hobin`
   - Random string format: `OYkC0ZbuWPOvwkLid-Dean-Hobin`
2. Insufficient search logic when looking for existing run records
3. Cache system not properly registering found records

### Solution Implemented
We implemented a comprehensive fix in the `services/recordCache.js` file that:

1. **Enhanced Search Logic**: The `updateClientRun` function now searches for existing records using multiple methods:
   - In-memory cache lookup
   - Original run ID search
   - Normalized run ID format search
   - Client ID-based searches with various formats
   - Base run ID search (without client suffix)

2. **Improved Cache Registration**: Existing records are now properly registered in the cache system to prevent future duplication.

3. **Last Resort Creation**: A new record is only created if all search methods fail to find an existing one.

4. **Run ID Format Handling**: The system now properly handles all known run ID formats.

### Files Modified
- `services/recordCache.js` - Core record caching and lookup logic
- Created `COMPREHENSIVE-RUN-RECORD-FIX.md` - Documentation of the fix

### Current Status
- ✅ Fix has been implemented, tested, and committed
- ✅ Changes pushed to the staging branch
- ✅ Fix successfully handles both run ID formats and prevents duplicate records

## Multi-Tenant Architecture Context

This system uses a multi-tenant architecture with:
- **Master Control**: Single "Clients" base contains client registry
- **Client Data**: Each client has a separate Airtable base (`My Leads - [Client Name]`)
- **Service Boundaries**: `services/clientService.js` handles switching between client bases
- **Data Flow**: Frontend sends `x-client-id` header with API calls, backend resolves client and operates on client-specific base

## Next Steps

1. **Testing in Staging**: Monitor the staging environment to ensure the fix prevents any new duplicate run records
2. **Production Deployment**: Once validated in staging, deploy to production
3. **Monitoring**: Set up specific monitoring to track any potential recurrence
4. **Documentation**: Update system documentation to reflect the changes and potential pitfalls

## Technical Notes

- The fix was implemented with consideration for the multi-tenant nature of the system
- Care was taken to maintain backward compatibility with existing records
- The solution prioritizes finding existing records through multiple search methods before creating new ones
- All changes align with the project's error isolation patterns
