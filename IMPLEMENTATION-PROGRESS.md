/**
 * Run ID Standardization Implementation Plan
 * 
 * Steps completed:
 * 
 * 1. Created JobTracking.standardizeRunId static method as the single source of truth
 *    for standardizing run IDs across the entire application
 * 
 * 2. Updated key methods in jobTracking.js to use the standardized approach:
 *    - getJobById
 *    - updateJob
 *    - createJob
 *    - getClientRun
 *    - createClientRun
 *    - updateClientRun
 *    - checkClientRunExists
 * 
 * 3. Updated API routes to use JobTracking.standardizeRunId
 *    - apifyWebhookRoutes.js
 * 
 * 4. Created documentation in RUN-ID-STANDARDIZATION-GUIDE.md
 * 
 * Future work:
 * 
 * 5. Complete full codebase search for any remaining hardcoded run ID handling
 * 6. Test all changes with live data
 * 7. Deploy and monitor for any regression issues
 * 
 * The standardized approach ensures:
 * - All run IDs are immediately converted to YYMMDD-HHMMSS format
 * - Only standardized run IDs are stored in the database
 * - All lookups use standardized run IDs and field name constants
 * - Future development follows the standardized pattern
