# Fix Post Scoring Issues

## Problem
Post scoring was not working properly even though posts were being successfully harvested. The view "Leads with Posts not yet scored" showed 17 posts ready for scoring, but they were not being processed.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Filter Conflict**: Additional filterByFormula was conflicting with the view's own filters
2. **Content Validation**: Not properly validating posts content before processing
3. **Debug Visibility**: Insufficient debugging to identify why posts weren't being processed

## Changes Made
1. **Removed conflicting filter**: Stopped applying additional filterByFormula when using the "Leads with Posts not yet scored" view, respecting the view's native filters instead
2. **Improved post content validation**: Added detailed validation to ensure only leads with valid posts content are processed
3. **Enhanced debugging**: Added comprehensive logging to track each step of the post selection and validation process
4. **Process locking**: Improved job status management to prevent race conditions

## Testing
These changes should be tested on the Guy Wilson client base first, as we can confirm 17 posts are ready for scoring there.
