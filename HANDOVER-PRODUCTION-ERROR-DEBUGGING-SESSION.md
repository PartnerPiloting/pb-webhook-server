# Handover: Production Error Debugging Session

**Date**: October 13, 2025  
**Branch**: `feature/comprehensive-field-standardization`  
**Session Duration**: ~2 hours  
**Current Status**: Ready for log analysis and debugging

---

## Executive Summary

We analyzed 17 production errors from the **Production Issues table** in Airtable, identified 5 unique root causes, fixed 1 issue, added debug logging for 4 others, and built an automated environment variable sync system. The system is now ready for the next debugging cycle.

**CRITICAL NEXT STEP**: Run the standalone log analyzer to capture errors with new debug output.

---

## What We Accomplished This Session

### 1. Production Error Analysis (17 errors → 5 unique issues)

**Issue #1 (2 errors, 11.8%)**: "Execution Log undefined" - CRITICAL  
- **Error**: `formatExecutionLog()` returning undefined instead of string
- **Impact**: Causes batch scoring crashes and Airtable update failures
- **Status**: ✅ Debug logging added (commit 55d1194)
- **Debug markers**: `[EXEC-LOG-DEBUG]` and `[UPDATE-LOG-DEBUG]`
- **Files**: `services/clientService.js` (lines 270-310, 400-475)

**Issue #2 (6 errors, 35.3%)**: "Record not found" - ERROR  
- **Error**: Job Tracking lookup fails for standalone runs
- **Root cause**: Standalone endpoints creating metric records they shouldn't
- **Status**: ✅ FIXED (commit ae4e168)
- **Solution**: Added `isStandalone: true` flag propagation
- **Files**: `routes/apiAndJobRoutes.js`, `batchScorer.js`, `services/runRecordAdapterSimple.js`

**Issue #3 (4 errors, 23.5%)**: "batch.*failed" - ERROR  
- **Error**: "Multi-Tenant Batch Run Failed Critically" alerts
- **Root cause**: Batch crashes when formatExecutionLog() returns undefined
- **Status**: ⏳ Symptom of Issue #1 (will be fixed when #1 is resolved)

**Issue #4 (3 errors, 17.6%)**: "INVALID_VALUE_FOR_COLUMN" - ERROR  
- **Error**: Airtable rejects undefined value for Execution Log field
- **Root cause**: Same as Issue #1
- **Status**: ⏳ Symptom of Issue #1

**Issue #5 (2 errors, 11.8%)**: "Failed to update" - ERROR  
- **Error**: "Failed to update client run: Field 'Execution Log' cannot accept the provided value"
- **Root cause**: Same as Issue #1
- **Status**: ⏳ Symptom of Issue #1

**Key Insight**: Issues #3, #4, #5 are all symptoms of Issue #1. Fixing Issue #1 will resolve 9 of the 17 errors (53%).

## Debug Logging Added (Commit 55d1194)

### Location: `services/clientService.js`

**updateExecutionLog() - Lines 270-310**
```javascript
// [UPDATE-LOG-DEBUG] markers
// Logs: executionData type, logEntry generation, Airtable update calls
// Stack traces when undefined/null/non-string values detected
```

**logExecution() - Lines 400-475**
```javascript
// [EXEC-LOG-DEBUG] markers
// Logs: executionData object, formatExecutionLog() calls, return values
// Critical checks before Airtable API calls
// Stack traces on failures
```

### What Debug Logs Will Reveal

When you run the log analyzer next, look for:
- `[EXEC-LOG-DEBUG]` - Shows exact execution flow in logExecution()
- `[UPDATE-LOG-DEBUG]` - Shows execution flow in updateExecutionLog()
- Stack traces showing where undefined values originate
- Type information for executionData parameters

---

## Test Run Completed (45 minutes ago)

**Endpoint**: `https://pb-webhook-server-staging.onrender.com/smart-resume-client-by-client?stream=1`

**What Happened**:
1. ✅ Deployed commits: ae4e168 (standalone fix) + 55d1194 (debug logging)
2. ✅ Ran test scoring job on staging
3. ✅ Waited 45 minutes for background processes to complete
4. ✅ Background jobs finished writing to Render logs
5. ✅ **User deleted all records from Production Issues table** (clean slate)

**Current State**:
- Render logs contain: debug output + new errors (if any)
- Production Issues table: EMPTY (ready for fresh analysis)
- Ready to run standalone analyzer

---

## Bootstrap System Built (Commit 50036e3)

**Problem Solved**: Manual env var copying was tedious, error-prone, caused secret commits twice

**Solution**: Automated sync from Render staging (master source of truth)

### Files Created

1. **`index.js` (lines 3295-3361)**: Secure `/api/export-env-vars` endpoint
   - Protected with `BOOTSTRAP_SECRET` bearer token
   - Returns 401 if unauthorized, 503 if not configured
   - Filters system variables (npm_*, NODE_*, PATH, etc.)

2. **`bootstrap-local-env.js`**: Local script to fetch and save env vars
   - HTTPS fetch from Render staging
   - Saves to `.env` file
   - Ensures `.gitignore` protection (bulletproof)
   - Checks age and prompts if > 24 hours old
   - Runs user script with fresh env vars

3. **`LOCAL-ENV-BOOTSTRAP-README.md`**: Complete documentation
4. **`BOOTSTRAP-SETUP-QUICKSTART.md`**: Quick start guide

### Setup (One-Time)

1. Add `BOOTSTRAP_SECRET` to Render dashboard (Environment tab)
2. Run `npm run local` and enter the same secret when prompted
3. Done! `.env` file now has all Render env vars

### Daily Usage

```bash
# Sync env vars and run a script
npm run local my-script.js

# Just sync env vars
npm run local

# Force refresh
npm run local -- --force
```

**Status**: ✅ System deployed and ready to use

---

## CRITICAL NEXT STEP: Run Standalone Log Analyzer

### Why This Is Next

1. ✅ Debug logging deployed (commit 55d1194)
2. ✅ Test run completed 45 minutes ago
3. ✅ Background processes finished writing to logs
4. ✅ Production Issues table cleared (empty)
5. ✅ Bootstrap system ready (can test locally now!)

### How to Run the Analyzer

**Option 1: Test Locally (RECOMMENDED - uses new bootstrap system)**

```bash
# Sync env vars from Render, then run analyzer
npm run local analyze-recent-logs.js
```

**Option 2: Run on Render Staging**

Call the API endpoint:
```bash
POST https://pb-webhook-server-staging.onrender.com/api/analyze-logs/recent
Body: { "minutes": 60 }
```

### What Will Happen

1. Analyzer scans last 60 minutes of Render logs
2. Pattern-based detection (31+ regex patterns, 97-98% accuracy)
3. Extracts errors with:
   - Full error messages
   - Stack traces
   - Debug output from `[EXEC-LOG-DEBUG]` and `[UPDATE-LOG-DEBUG]` markers
   - Context (25 lines before/after)
4. Saves to Production Issues table with:
   - Error message
   - Severity (CRITICAL/ERROR/WARNING)
   - Pattern matched
   - Stack trace link
   - Run ID (from test run)
   - Timestamp

### What to Look For

**If Issue #1 is still happening:**
- Errors mentioning "Execution Log", "INVALID_VALUE_FOR_COLUMN", "undefined"
- `[EXEC-LOG-DEBUG]` markers showing formatExecutionLog() flow
- Stack traces pointing to exact line in clientService.js

**If Issue #2 is fixed:**
- Should see ZERO "Record not found" errors
- Confirms standalone flag fix worked

**If new errors appear:**
- Different root causes we haven't seen yet
- Could indicate edge cases or race conditions

---

## Debugging Workflow (After Analyzer Runs)

### Step 1: Review Production Issues Table

Go to Airtable → Master Clients base → Production Issues table

**Filter by severity:**
- CRITICAL → Fix immediately
- ERROR → Fix soon
- WARNING → Review (may be noise)

**Group by pattern:**
- See which errors are most frequent
- Identify root causes vs. symptoms

### Step 2: Examine Debug Output

For Issue #1 (Execution Log undefined):

1. Find errors with pattern: "Execution Log" or "INVALID_VALUE_FOR_COLUMN"
2. Click Stack Trace link to see file/line numbers
3. Search Render logs for `[EXEC-LOG-DEBUG]` around same timestamp
4. Look for:
   - What value does formatExecutionLog() receive?
   - What does it return?
   - Where does undefined come from?

### Step 3: Implement Fix

Based on debug output, implement root cause fix in `services/clientService.js`

**Likely scenarios:**
- formatExecutionLog() has a code path that returns undefined
- executionData parameter is malformed
- String formatting fails on certain input types

### Step 4: Test Fix Locally

```bash
# Run local test with fresh env vars
npm run local test-format-execution-log-local.js
```

### Step 5: Deploy and Verify

1. Commit fix with descriptive message
2. Push to trigger Render deployment
3. Run another test scoring job
4. Wait for background processes (5-10 minutes)
5. Re-run analyzer
6. Verify errors are gone

### Step 6: Mark Issues as FIXED

```bash
# Use the cleanup API
POST https://pb-webhook-server-staging.onrender.com/api/mark-issue-fixed
Body: {
  "pattern": "Execution Log",
  "commitHash": "abc1234",
  "fixNotes": "Fixed formatExecutionLog to handle edge case where executionData is null"
}
```

This marks ALL matching unfixed issues as FIXED (across all runs).

## Testing Workflow

### 1. Run Analyzer Locally

```bash
# Fetch latest env vars and run analyzer
npm run local analyze-recent-logs.js
```

**Expected output**:
- Connects to Render staging
- Fetches last 60 minutes of logs
- Scans with 31+ error patterns
- Saves errors to Production Issues table
- Prints summary: X errors found, Y CRITICAL, Z ERROR

### 2. Check Production Issues Table

Go to Airtable → Master Clients base → Production Issues

**What to verify**:
- Errors captured from test run (45 minutes ago)
- Debug output included in error messages
- Stack traces linked
- Severity correctly classified

### 3. Investigate Top Error

**Priority order**:
1. CRITICAL severity (fix immediately)
2. ERROR with highest frequency
3. ERROR with clear root cause
4. WARNING (may be noise - review carefully)

### 4. Search Render Logs for Debug Output

```bash
# Use Render dashboard or CLI
# Search for: [EXEC-LOG-DEBUG] or [UPDATE-LOG-DEBUG]
# Around timestamp of error from Production Issues
```

### 5. Implement Fix

Based on debug output, fix root cause in code

### 6. Test Fix

```bash
# Run local test
npm run local test-format-execution-log-local.js

# If test passes, commit and deploy
git add services/clientService.js
git commit -m "Fix Issue #1: formatExecutionLog handling of null executionData"
git push
```

### 7. Verify on Staging

```bash
# Wait for Render deployment (~2 minutes)
# Run test scoring job again
# Wait for background processes (~5 minutes)
# Re-run analyzer
npm run local analyze-recent-logs.js

# Check if error is gone
```

### 8. Mark as FIXED

```bash
# Call cleanup API with commit hash
POST /api/mark-issue-fixed
{
  "pattern": "Execution Log",
  "commitHash": "abc1234",
  "fixNotes": "Fixed formatExecutionLog to handle null executionData"
}
```

---

## Known Issues & Edge Cases

### Issue #1: formatExecutionLog() returns undefined

**Symptoms**:
- "INVALID_VALUE_FOR_COLUMN" errors
- "Field 'Execution Log' cannot accept the provided value"
- Batch scoring crashes

**Debug approach**:
1. Check `[EXEC-LOG-DEBUG]` output in logs
2. See what executionData is passed to formatExecutionLog()
3. Trace code path that returns undefined
4. Add null checks or default value

### Issue #2: Standalone mode (FIXED)

**Status**: ✅ FIXED in commit ae4e168

**What was wrong**:
- Standalone endpoints (/run-batch-score) were creating Job Tracking records
- Later lookups failed because records shouldn't exist for standalone runs

**How we fixed it**:
- Added `isStandalone: true` flag to endpoint
- Propagated through batchScorer.js → completeRunRecord
- Service layer checks flag and returns {skipped: true}

**Verification**:
- Should see ZERO "Record not found" errors in next analysis
- If still appearing, flag propagation has a gap

### Bootstrap System

**Status**: ✅ Deployed and ready

**Potential issues**:
1. BOOTSTRAP_SECRET not set on Render → Returns 503
2. Wrong BOOTSTRAP_SECRET in local .env → Returns 401
3. Network timeout → Increase timeout in bootstrap-local-env.js

**Troubleshooting**:
- Check Render dashboard → Environment tab
- Verify BOOTSTRAP_SECRET exists
- Test endpoint: `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer SECRET" https://pb-webhook-server-staging.onrender.com/api/export-env-vars`

---

## Expected Outcomes

### After Running Analyzer

**Best case**:
- Issue #2 errors: 0 (FIXED ✅)
- Issue #1 errors: Still present but with debug output
- Debug logs clearly show root cause
- Can implement fix immediately

**Worst case**:
- Issue #1 errors: Still present, debug logs insufficient
- Need more detailed logging
- Add additional debug markers and re-test

**Surprise case**:
- New errors appear (different root causes)
- Indicates edge cases or race conditions
- Prioritize by severity and frequency

### After Fixing Issue #1

**Expected result**:
- Issues #3, #4, #5 also disappear (they're symptoms of #1)
- 9 of 17 original errors resolved (53%)
- Batch scoring runs without crashes
- Execution Log field updates successfully

---

## Questions for Next Session

1. **Did the analyzer run successfully?**
   - Any errors connecting to Render?
   - Did it populate Production Issues table?

2. **What errors were captured?**
   - How many CRITICAL vs ERROR vs WARNING?
   - Is Issue #2 gone (record not found)?
   - Is Issue #1 still present (Execution Log undefined)?

3. **Do debug logs reveal the root cause?**
   - What does `[EXEC-LOG-DEBUG]` show?
   - Can we see where undefined comes from?
   - Is it a code path issue or data issue?

4. **Are there new/unexpected errors?**
   - Different from the original 5 issues?
   - Higher or lower priority?

5. **Is the bootstrap system working?**
   - Did `npm run local` fetch env vars successfully?
   - Can you run local scripts now?

## Communication Notes

### What User Said (Context)

> "About an hour ago we looked at the Table Production Issues and of the 17 issues in there you identified 5 were unique and either you fixed them or you added debugs to go into the render log when we do a test run so that next time we run https://pb-webhook-server-staging.onrender.com/smart-resume-client-by-client?stream=1 the new errors and debugs would go into the render log."

> "I did run that after your changes were deployed and that was about 45 minutes ago which means the background processes will have finished and written to the render log as well."

> "I deleted all records from the Production Issues table so that when we run our standalone render analyser it should recreate records with your debugs and also new errors for us to fix."

> "Running the standalone analyser would be our next step and now that we have a local .env file you should be able to test locally."

### What This Means

1. ✅ Test run completed 45 minutes ago
2. ✅ Background processes finished (~40 minutes is enough)
3. ✅ Render logs contain debug output + errors
4. ✅ Production Issues table empty (clean slate)
5. ✅ Bootstrap system ready (can test locally)
6. ✅ Next step: Run analyzer to populate Production Issues with fresh data

### User's Expectations

- Analyzer will capture errors with debug output
- We can test locally now (using bootstrap system)
- Next chat will focus on debugging based on analyzer results
- Goal: Fix remaining issues (primarily Issue #1)

---

## Success Criteria

**For Next Session**:
1. ✅ Analyzer runs successfully (locally or on Render)
2. ✅ Production Issues table populated with fresh errors
3. ✅ Debug output visible in error messages or logs
4. ✅ Root cause of Issue #1 identified
5. ✅ Fix implemented and tested
6. ✅ Errors disappear after fix
7. ✅ Mark all issues as FIXED

**Overall Goal**:
