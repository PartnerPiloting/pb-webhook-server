# LinkedIn Follow-Up Portal - Development Progress

## Last Updated: December 2024

## Overview
This document tracks the development progress of the LinkedIn Follow-Up Portal, documenting completed features, technical decisions, and important implementation details.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js app deployed on Vercel at `pb-webhook-server.vercel.app`
- **Backend**: Express API deployed on Render at `pb-webhook-server.onrender.com`
- **Database**: Airtable (multi-tenant architecture)
- **Repository**: Single monorepo containing both frontend and backend

## Completed Features

### Field Mapping Fixes & UI Improvements (COMPLETED ✅ - December 2024)

#### Fixed Field Name Inconsistencies
- **Root Cause**: Frontend and backend were using different field names than Airtable
- **Resolution**: Aligned all field names with Airtable as single source of truth:
  - `Follow-Up Date` (with hyphen) - was incorrectly `Follow Up Date` in frontend
  - `ASH Workshop Email` - was incorrectly `Add to Workshop Invite List`
  - Removed non-existent `Follow Up Notes` field references
  
#### UI Improvements
- **Button Placement**: Moved Reset/Update buttons to top of form for better accessibility
- **Notes Field Enhancement**: 
  - Added URL detection to make links clickable
  - Toggle between edit and preview modes
  - URLs automatically become clickable links in preview mode
  
#### Updated Files
- `LinkedIn-Messaging-FollowUp/docs/airtable-field-master-list.md` - Updated to reflect actual Airtable field names
- `LinkedIn-Messaging-FollowUp/backend-extensions/routes/linkedinRoutes.js` - Fixed field mappings
- `linkedin-messaging-followup-next/components/LeadSearchUpdate.js` - Added missing field mappings
- `linkedin-messaging-followup-next/components/LeadDetailForm.js` - Fixed field names, moved buttons, added URL detection

### 1. Lead Search & Update (COMPLETED ✅)

#### UI/UX Improvements
- **Airtable-style Layout**
  - Full-width screen usage (removed max-width constraints)
  - Left-aligned labels with narrow width (~10% for labels, ~90% for inputs)
  - Single-column vertical layout
  - Professional typography and spacing
  
- **Sidebar Improvements**
  - Width distribution: 25% sidebar, 75% main content
  - Increased sidebar height from 384px to 600px
  - Shows ~9-10 leads instead of ~6-7
  - Alphabetical sorting by first name, then last name

- **Form Enhancements**
  - Clearable follow-up dates with "× Clear" button
  - Helper text: "Leave blank for no follow-up"
  - Removed redundant Profile Key field from top
  - Removed external link icon from LinkedIn URL field
  - Smaller, more readable text in Notes field

#### Search Functionality
- **Backend Search Improvements**
  - Increased result limit from 50 to 200 leads
  - Changed sorting from AI Score to alphabetical (First Name, Last Name)
  - Implemented smart partial search:
    - Single word: "justin" → searches both first and last names
    - Multi-word: "justin c" → first name contains "justin" AND last name starts with "c"
  - Uses Airtable FIND function for reliable case-insensitive search

- **Search Examples That Work**
  - "justin" → finds all Justins
  - "justin c" → finds Justin Connolly
  - "andrew" → finds all Andrews
  - Full name searches: "justin connolly"

#### Workflow Optimization
- **Section Order** (prioritized for daily use):
  1. Follow-up Management (with Notes)
  2. Basic Information
  3. Status & Classification
  4. Scores (renamed: Profile Score, Top Post's Score)
  
- **Removed Fields**
  - Follow-up Notes (didn't exist in system)
  - Multi-tenant label from header

### 2. Technical Implementation Details

#### Backend Search Function
```javascript
// Located in: LinkedIn-Messaging-FollowUp/backend-extensions/routes/linkedinRoutes.js
function buildSearchFormula(searchQuery) {
    const query = searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();
    
    if (query.includes(' ')) {
        // Multi-word search
        const parts = query.split(/\s+/);
        const [firstPart, ...restParts] = parts;
        const lastPart = restParts.join(' ');
        
        return `AND(
            FIND("${firstPart}", LOWER({First Name})) > 0,
            FIND("${lastPart}", LOWER({Last Name})) = 1
        )`;
    }
    
    // Single word search
    return `OR(
        FIND("${query}", LOWER({First Name})) > 0,
        FIND("${query}", LOWER({Last Name})) > 0
    )`;
}
```

#### Key Files Modified
- `linkedin-messaging-followup-next/components/LeadDetailForm.js` - Form layout and field management
- `linkedin-messaging-followup-next/components/LeadSearchUpdate.js` - Search and list display
- `linkedin-messaging-followup-next/components/Layout.js` - Full-width layout
- `LinkedIn-Messaging-FollowUp/backend-extensions/routes/linkedinRoutes.js` - Backend search logic

### 3. Deployment Configuration
- **Auto-deployment enabled**: Both Vercel and Render deploy automatically on `git push`
- **No manual deployment needed**: Changes propagate automatically
- **Deployment time**: 
  - Vercel (frontend): ~2-5 minutes
  - Render (backend): ~10-15 minutes

### 4. Known Issues Resolved
- ✅ Search returning empty results for names not in first 50 records
- ✅ Partial name searches not working (e.g., "justin c")
- ✅ Sorting by AI Score instead of alphabetically
- ✅ Multi-tenant label showing in header
- ✅ Follow-up date not clearable

## Next Steps

### Follow-Up Manager (TO DO)
- Display leads with follow-up dates
- Calendar view or list view
- Bulk actions for follow-ups
- Follow-up reminders/notifications

### New Leads (TO DO)
- Review recently added leads
- Bulk scoring capabilities
- Quick triage interface

## Important Technical Notes

1. **Search Limitations**: Backend limited to 200 results for performance. May need pagination for larger datasets.

2. **Field Mapping**: Frontend uses camelCase, backend uses Airtable field names:
   - `firstName` ↔ `First Name`
   - `linkedinProfileUrl` ↔ `LinkedIn Profile URL`
   - etc.

3. **Multi-tenant Architecture**: All API calls require `client` parameter (currently hardcoded to 'Guy-Wilson')

4. **CORS Configuration**: Backend configured to accept requests from Vercel domain
