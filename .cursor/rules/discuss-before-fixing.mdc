# Discuss Before Fixing

When a user reports an issue or problem, DO NOT immediately jump to implementing a fix.

## Required Steps

1. **Ask clarifying questions** - Make sure you understand the full picture
2. **Confirm the root cause** - Verify your understanding of what's actually wrong
3. **Propose the approach** - Explain what you plan to do and why
4. **Get user agreement** - Wait for confirmation before implementing

## Why This Matters

- You often don't have the full context
- The user may have additional information that changes the approach
- Premature fixes can introduce new problems
- The user may prefer a different solution

## Example

❌ **BAD**: User reports "Meeting notes don't show the date" → Immediately write code to fix it

✅ **GOOD**: User reports "Meeting notes don't show the date" → Ask:
- "What format do the Meeting notes use?"
- "Should it show the most recent date or the first date?"
- "Can you share an example of the content?"

Then propose the fix and wait for agreement before implementing.
