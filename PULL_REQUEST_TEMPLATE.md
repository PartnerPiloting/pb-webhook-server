## Job Tracking Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Using unified `JobTracking` class for all job tracking operations
- [ ] Removed references to legacy tracking systems (`simpleJobTracking`, etc.)
- [ ] Method calls use the correct `JobTracking` methods:
  - [ ] `JobTracking.generateRunId()` for ID generation
  - [ ] `JobTracking.createJob()` for creating main job records
  - [ ] `JobTracking.updateJob()` for updating main job records
  - [ ] `JobTracking.createClientRun()` for creating client-specific records
  - [ ] `JobTracking.updateClientRun()` for updating client-specific records
  - [ ] `JobTracking.completeJob()` for completing jobs

## Airtable Field Validation

- [ ] Field names used in updates match actual Airtable schema
- [ ] Status values follow the standardized options (Running, Completed, Failed, etc.)
- [ ] Date/time fields use ISO format
- [ ] System Notes provide clear, descriptive messages
- [ ] No custom fields are used that don't exist in Airtable

## Error Handling

- [ ] Job tracking operations are wrapped in try/catch blocks
- [ ] Errors are logged with appropriate context (runId, clientId)
- [ ] Main process continues even if tracking operations fail
- [ ] Duplicate record prevention is implemented
- [ ] Field validation prevents schema errors

## Multi-tenant Patterns

- [ ] Client operations are properly isolated with clientId
- [ ] Client-specific bases are accessed via getClientBase()
- [ ] x-client-id header is properly extracted and validated
- [ ] Client failures don't affect other clients
- [ ] Client operations logged with client context

## Code Quality

- [ ] Clean architecture principles are followed
- [ ] No duplicated code
- [ ] Functions have clear single responsibilities
- [ ] Code is properly commented
- [ ] Consistent naming conventions are used

## Testing

- [ ] Changes are tested in development environment
- [ ] Multi-tenant functionality is verified
- [ ] Error handling is tested
- [ ] Edge cases are considered

## Documentation

- [ ] Code includes JSDoc comments
- [ ] README or other docs are updated if needed
- [ ] Complex logic is explained in comments

## Other Considerations

- [ ] Performance impact is minimized
- [ ] Legacy code is properly archived or removed
- [ ] No hardcoded values or magic strings
