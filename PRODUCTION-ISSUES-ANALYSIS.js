// ANALYSIS OF REMAINING PRODUCTION ISSUES
// Date: October 14, 2025
// Run: 251013-114042

/**
 * SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
 * 
 * Looking at the 10 "unfixed" issues, they fall into these categories:
 * 
 * 1. ‚úÖ ALREADY FIXED (4 issues - awaiting verification in next run)
 *    - 1x CRITICAL: Execution Log "undefined" error 
 *    - 1x ERROR: Failed to update client run (same root cause)
 *    - 1x ERROR: Batch failed critically (symptom of above)
 *    - 1x ERROR: INVALID_VALUE_FOR_COLUMN (symptom of above)
 *    All from run 251013-114042, Guy Wilson client
 *    Fixed in commit 4fe4e6c with malformed error diagnostics
 * 
 * 2. ‚úÖ ALREADY FIXED (2 issues - batch false positives)
 *    - 2x ERROR: batch.*failed matching "0 failed" success messages
 *    Fixed in commit 6a5847b with refined error patterns
 * 
 * 3. üîç DEBUG LOGS (Multiple - temporary, working as intended)
 *    - Multiple WARNING: DEBUG-CRR logs from run 251013-114042
 *    These are the diagnostics we added to investigate Status field bug
 *    Will remove pattern after bug is fixed
 * 
 * 4. ‚ö†Ô∏è LOW PRIORITY (1 issue - noise)
 *    - 1x WARNING: Deprecation warning for utils/runIdGenerator.js
 *    Can mark as IGNORED
 * 
 * CONCLUSION:
 * All "real" errors are already fixed. The remaining unfixed issues are:
 * - Symptoms of the Execution Log bug we fixed (4 issues)
 * - False positive batch errors we fixed (2 issues)
 * - Debug logs we intentionally added (multiple)
 * - Low priority deprecation warning (1 issue)
 * 
 * NO NEW ISSUES TO ADDRESS.
 * 
 * NEXT STEPS:
 * 1. Deploy current fixes to Render
 * 2. Run batch job after deployment
 * 3. Wait 15 minutes for background jobs
 * 4. Run log analyzer
 * 5. Verify all these issues are GONE from Production Issues table
 * 6. Investigate Status field bug using DEBUG-STATUS-UPDATE logs
 * 7. Remove DEBUG-CRR and DEBUG-STATUS-UPDATE patterns after Status bug fixed
