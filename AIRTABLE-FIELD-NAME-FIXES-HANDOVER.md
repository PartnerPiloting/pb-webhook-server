# Airtable Field Name Fixes Handover

## Overview

This document captures fixes made to field name inconsistencies between our codebase and the Airtable schema. These inconsistencies were causing runtime errors as the code attempted to access fields that didn't exist with the specified names.

**Date:** September 29, 2025  
**Branch:** feature/airtable-service-boundaries  
**Commit:** Fix Client field name in airtableServiceSimple.js to Client ID

## Fixed Issues

### 1. 'Client' vs 'Client ID' Field

**Location:** `services/airtableServiceSimple.js`  
**Description:** The field was incorrectly named 'Client' in the `createClientRunRecord` function but should have been 'Client ID' to match the Airtable schema.

**Fix Applied:**
```javascript
// BEFORE
fields: {
  'Run ID': runId,
  'Client': clientId,  // Changed from 'Client ID' to 'Client' to match Airtable field name
  // other fields...
}

// AFTER
fields: {
  'Run ID': runId,
  'Client ID': clientId,  // Fixed from 'Client' to 'Client ID' to match Airtable schema
  // other fields...
}
```

### 2. Previous Fixes (From Earlier Work)

The following field name issues were fixed in previous commits:

1. **'Source' Field**: The code was using 'Source' but the actual field in Airtable is 'System Notes'.
   - Fix: Changed references from 'Source' to 'System Notes'.

2. **'Recovery Note' Field**: The code was using 'Recovery Note' but this field doesn't exist in Airtable. The actual field is 'System Notes'.
   - Fix: Changed references from 'Recovery Note' to 'System Notes'.

3. **'Jobs Started' Field**: The code was using 'Jobs Started' but this field doesn't exist in Airtable.
   - Fix: Changed to store this information in 'System Notes' instead.

## Verified Files

The following files were checked and fixed as needed:

1. `services/airtable/clientRepository.js` 
2. `services/airtable/runRecordRepository.js`
3. `services/airtable/jobTrackingRepository.js`
4. `services/airtableServiceSimple.js`
5. `services/runRecordAdapterSimple.js`

## Testing

These fixes address the Airtable field name mismatch errors appearing in the Render logs. The application should now be able to properly create, update, and query records in the Airtable bases using the correct field names.

### Error Symptoms Resolved

The following errors should no longer appear in the Render logs:

```
❌ FATAL: Failed to create client run record: INVALID_REQUEST_PARAMETER: Unknown field name: Client
```

```
❌ FATAL: Failed to create client run record: INVALID_REQUEST_PARAMETER: Unknown field name: Source
```

```
❌ FATAL: Failed to update job tracking record: INVALID_REQUEST_PARAMETER: Unknown field name: Recovery Note
```

```
❌ FATAL: Failed to update client run record: INVALID_REQUEST_PARAMETER: Unknown field name: Jobs Started
```

## Best Practices for Future Development

1. **Field Name Consistency**: Always refer to Airtable field names exactly as they appear in the Airtable UI, including spaces and capitalization.
2. **Schema Documentation**: Consider maintaining a central schema document that lists all Airtable fields and their exact names.
3. **Repository Pattern**: Continue using the repository pattern to encapsulate Airtable field access, which makes it easier to update field names in one place.
4. **Field Name Constants**: Consider defining field names as constants in a single location to prevent typos and ensure consistency.
5. **Runtime Validation**: Add validation that checks if field names exist in the Airtable schema before attempting to access them.

## Deployment Notes

After deploying these changes:
1. Monitor the Render logs for any remaining field name mismatch errors
2. Verify that client run records are being created correctly
3. Check that metrics updates are working properly
4. Ensure that job tracking records are being updated successfully
