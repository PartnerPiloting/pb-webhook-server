## Complete Reference for Multi-Environment Development Workflow

**Last Updated**: August 3, 2025  
**Project**: pb-webhook-server (Node.js + Next.js)  
**Deployment**: Render (backend) + Vercel (frontend)  
**Database**: Airtable (multi-environment bases)

## 🎯 QUICK REFERENCE - SAY THESE PHRASES

### **Environment Switching (Zero Manual Work)**
- `"Switch to development mode"` → Safe testing with dev database
- `"Switch to staging mode"` → Major features with staging database  
- `"Switch to production mode"` → Live data (careful!)
- `"Switch to hotfix mode"` → Emergency fixes with production data

### **Server Management**
- `"Start the front and back end for my full stack development"` → Both servers running
- `"Restart my development environment"` → After computer restart
- `"Can you restart my local dev environment?"` → Alternative phrasing

### **Deployment & Git Management**
- `"Prepare staging for deployment"` → Merge hotfixes, set up testing
- `"Deploy to production"` → After testing passes
- `"Show me what hotfixes you found"` → Review before applying

## 🏗️ COMPLETE ENVIRONMENT ARCHITECTURE

### **Environment Structure**
```
🔴 PRODUCTION   → main branch → Live client data (appXySOLo6V9PfMfa)
🟡 STAGING      → staging branch → Major features (appSTG123example456)
🟢 DEVELOPMENT  → development branch → Daily dev work (appDEV123example456)
🔥 HOTFIX       → hotfix/* branches → Emergency fixes (appXySOLo6V9PfMfa)
```

### **Detailed Environment Modes**

#### **🟢 DEVELOPMENT MODE**
**Purpose**: Daily coding and experimentation
- **Safety Level**: 🟢 **SAFE** - Break things freely
- **Data**: Test/fake data only
- **Database**: `appDEV123example456` (development Airtable base)
- **Branch**: `development` branch
- **Chrome Profile**: Development (green theme)

**When to Use:**
- Monday morning coding sessions
- Building new features from scratch
- Bug fixing and testing solutions
- Experimenting with new libraries/approaches
- Learning and trying "what if" scenarios

**Example Workflow:**
```
🟢 Development Session:
1. "Switch to development mode"
2. Build new lead scoring algorithm
3. Create test leads in dev database
4. Break things, fix them, iterate quickly
5. Test with fake data - no risk to real clients
6. Commit frequently to development branch
```

**Real-World Example:**
*You want to add a new scoring feature that analyzes LinkedIn profiles. You switch to development mode, create fake LinkedIn profiles in your dev database, code the feature, test it thoroughly, and iterate until it works perfectly.*

#### **🟡 STAGING MODE**
**Purpose**: Final testing before production deployment
- **Safety Level**: 🟡 **CAUTION** - Near-production testing
- **Data**: Production-like data (safe copy)
- **Database**: `appSTG123example456` (staging Airtable base)
- **Branch**: `staging` branch
- **Chrome Profile**: Staging (yellow theme)

**When to Use:**
- Feature is complete and ready for final testing
- Integration testing with multiple features
- Client preview and approval sessions
- Pre-deployment validation
- Testing with realistic data volumes

**Example Workflow:**
```
🟡 Staging Session:
1. "Switch to staging mode"
2. Test completed lead scoring algorithm
3. Use production-like data for realistic testing
4. Full integration testing with other features
5. Client review: "Here's the next release"
6. Final approval before production deployment
```

**Real-World Example:**
*Your LinkedIn scoring feature is complete. You switch to staging mode, copy some real (but anonymized) LinkedIn profiles to staging database, test the complete user flow, show it to your client for approval, and verify it works with realistic data volumes.*

#### **🔴 PRODUCTION MODE**
**Purpose**: Live environment with real client data
- **Safety Level**: 🔴 **DANGEROUS** - Real users affected
- **Data**: Live client data
- **Database**: `appXySOLo6V9PfMfa` (production Airtable base)
- **Branch**: `main` branch
- **Chrome Profile**: Production (red theme)

**When to Use:**
- Monitoring live system performance
- Investigating production issues
- Testing hotfixes against real data (very carefully)
- Production maintenance and monitoring

**Example Workflow:**
```
🔴 Production Monitoring:
1. "Switch to production mode"
2. Monitor live lead scoring performance
3. Check real client data quality
4. Investigate any production issues
5. ⚠️ EXTREME CAUTION - every action affects real users
```

**Real-World Example:**
*Your client reports that lead scores seem off. You switch to production mode, carefully examine real lead data, identify the issue, but DO NOT fix it in production mode. Instead, you reproduce the issue in development mode and create a proper fix.*

#### **🔥 HOTFIX MODE**
**Purpose**: Emergency fixes with production data for testing
- **Safety Level**: 🔥 **EXTREME CAUTION** - Live data, urgent fixes
- **Data**: Production data (same as live!)
- **Database**: `appXySOLo6V9PfMfa` (production database)
- **Branch**: `hotfix/*` branches
- **Chrome Profile**: Hotfix (red/orange warning theme)

**When to Use:**
- Production is broken and needs immediate fix
- Emergency patches that can't wait for normal deployment
- Critical bug fixes affecting live users
- Time-sensitive security patches

**Example Workflow:**
```
🔥 Emergency Hotfix:
1. "Switch to hotfix mode"
2. Create hotfix branch from main
3. Make minimal, targeted fix
4. Test against real production data (carefully!)
5. Deploy immediately to fix live issue
6. Later: merge hotfix into staging for future releases
```

**Real-World Example:**
*At 2 PM on Friday, your lead scoring system crashes and your client can't process new leads. You switch to hotfix mode, quickly identify it's a timeout issue, apply a minimal fix, test it against real data (being extremely careful), deploy the fix, and restore service within 30 minutes.*

### **Environment Comparison Table**

| Aspect | Development 🟢 | Staging 🟡 | Production 🔴 | Hotfix 🔥 |
|--------|---------------|-------------|---------------|-----------|
| **Purpose** | Build features | Test completed features | Live system | Emergency fixes |
| **Data Quality** | Fake/test data | Production-like | Real client data | Real client data |
| **Stability** | Unstable, changing | Stable, release candidate | Stable, live | Broken, needs fixing |
| **Risk Level** | Zero risk | Low risk | High risk | Extreme risk |
| **Changes** | Frequent, experimental | Infrequent, deliberate | Monitoring only | Minimal, urgent |
| **Client Access** | Never | Sometimes (preview) | Always | Emergency only |
| **Testing Type** | Unit/feature testing | Integration testing | Performance monitoring | Fix validation |

## 🚀 COMPLETE WORKFLOW EXAMPLES

### **Daily Development Workflow**
1. **Start Day**: `"Switch to development mode"`
   - AI copies `.env.development` → `.env`
   - Starts localhost:3000 (backend) + localhost:3001 (frontend)
   - Reminds to use Development Chrome profile (green)
   - Connected to dev database (safe to break)

2. **Make Changes**: Edit code, auto-restart via nodemon
3. **Test Locally**: localhost:3001 → localhost:3000 → dev database
4. **Commit & Push**: `git push origin development`

### **Major Feature Deployment Workflow**
1. **Prepare**: `"Prepare staging for deployment"`
   - AI discovers hotfixes in production
   - Merges hotfixes into staging
   - Sets up test environment with staging + hotfixes
   - Provides testing checklist

2. **Test Combined**: Test new features + hotfixes work together
3. **Deploy**: `"Deploy to production"`
   - AI merges staging → main
   - Both new features and hotfixes go live

### **Emergency Hotfix Workflow**
1. **Emergency**: `"Switch to hotfix mode"`
   - AI creates hotfix branch from main
   - Connects to production database (live data!)
   - Reminds to use Hotfix Chrome profile (red warnings)

2. **Fix & Test**: Minimal changes, test against real data
3. **Deploy**: Push hotfix branch → auto-deploys to production
4. **Return**: `"Switch back to development mode"`

### **Environment Switching**
**You**: `"Switch to staging mode"`
**AI**:
```
🔄 Switching to STAGING environment...
📁 Copying .env.staging → .env
🗄️ Database: appSTG123example456 (staging data)
🔄 Restarting servers...
✅ Staging mode active!
🌐 Use Staging Chrome profile (🟡 yellow theme)
⚠️ This affects pre-production data
```

### **Pre-Deployment**
**You**: `"Prepare staging for deployment"`
**AI**:
```
🔍 Analyzing branches...
📊 Staging has: New scoring algorithm, Dashboard improvements
🚨 Found 2 hotfixes in production missing from staging:
   • API timeout fix (Wednesday)
   • Database patch (Thursday)
🔄 Applying hotfixes to staging...
✅ Ready for testing!
📋 Test: New features + hotfixes work together
💡 Say "Deploy to production" when satisfied
